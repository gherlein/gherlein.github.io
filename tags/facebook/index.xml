      <description>I left Facebook to get away from all the hate. But there&amp;rsquo;s community information there I find valuable and so I signed up again (after years away). And my account is suspended!&#xA;Somehow I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow their community standards EVEN BEFORE I LOGGED IN! I can tell you that all I ever did was leave Facebook and delete my account there. I certainly never &amp;ldquo;violated thier community standards&amp;rdquo; (as if they really have them with the hate they promote).</description>
