      <title>Builders Build</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From a certain point of view, there are two kinds of people in the world: builders and not-builders. This isn&amp;rsquo;t judgment—it&amp;rsquo;s observation. Some people consume. Others create. &lt;strong&gt;Builders can&amp;rsquo;t help it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Amazon built an empire on this insight. From their earliest days, they focused on creating &amp;ldquo;a culture of builders—people who are curious, explorers.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s baked into their leadership principles and hiring process. They don&amp;rsquo;t just want employees; they want people who wake up thinking about what they can make.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SaaS is Dead, Long Live Platforms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI has made code cheap and abundant. The scarce resource is now knowing &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; to build, not &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;. This is creating a rapid split between companies that sell workflows and companies that sell capabilities. Only one of these will survive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Scottish football manager once said, &amp;ldquo;Some people think football is more important than life. But they are wrong. It&amp;rsquo;s much more important than that.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;When intelligence becomes a utility, the ability to ACT on it becomes everything.&lt;/strong&gt;  In today&amp;rsquo;s software world, Agency is more important than anything else!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Miss the Train!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The AI train has left the station. Some of us are on board, generating entire modules from specs. Others are still on the platform debating whether the train is even real. Four smart people wrote about this shift this past week. They all agree on what it means. And I agree with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Software development is stratifying into three distinct tiers. Where you land will determine whether you make more money, the same, or far less than today.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The US Navy gave me a solid foundation in leadership and operational excellence.  But translating that into the business world requires a few more things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
