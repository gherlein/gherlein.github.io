        &lt;p&gt;How I mapped some basic keys to be the same on MacOS and Ubuntu and saved my sanity. UPDATED! UPDATED AGAIN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I move back and forth between MacOS and Ubuntu.  I work in the terminal a lot and I&amp;rsquo;m shifting to using &lt;a href=&#34;https://zed.dev/&#34;&gt;zed&lt;/a&gt; as my primary work editor.  Why?  It&amp;rsquo;s fast, and it&amp;rsquo;s EASY to configure.  For me the learning curve of VSCode is too steep and I don&amp;rsquo;t need all the features.  I just need a fast editor that I can EASILY configure to my liking.  Oh, that is easy to bind an LLM to for assisted code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ARE using an LLM, right?  If not, you should be.  I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://copilot.github.com&#34;&gt;CoPilot&lt;/a&gt; and am testing &lt;a href=&#34;https://zed.dev/docs/assistant/configuration&#34;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI won&amp;rsquo;t take your coding job.  But another developer skilled in using AI almost certainly will.  You have been warned!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update---possible-overkill-but-it-works-sort-of-works&#34;&gt;UPDATE - Possible Overkill But It &lt;del&gt;Works&lt;/del&gt; sort of works!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This intercepts all keypresses at the X11 level and remaps the Super key to the Control key.  This means that a super-c becomes a control-c.  Probably not what you want if you use an actual linux terminal (and I do).  But the alternative is to remap the keys at the application layer, and that means doing each one, one by one&amp;hellip;  ugh.  I will probably back this out unless I can find a &amp;ldquo;terminal&amp;rdquo; program that is actually an X11 program and not a terminal emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warning--this-will-whack-your-terminal-keybindings&#34;&gt;Warning:  this will whack your terminal keybindings!!!!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit a new file .Xmodmap in your home directory and add the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;remove mod4 &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Super_L
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;keysym Super_L &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Control_L
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;add Control &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; Control_L
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will remap the Super key to the Control key.  This is a bit of overkill, but it works.  I&amp;rsquo;m still testing it, but so far it seems to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this works for you then you can probably skip the rest of this article.  I&amp;rsquo;m leaving it here for reference and in case the above doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works for me because I don&amp;rsquo;t use the Super key for anything else.  If you do, then maybe don&amp;rsquo;t do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CREDIT:  I found this in an &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/848048/how-to-bind-super-c-and-super-v-to-copy-and-paste-in-gnome-terminal&#34;&gt;8 year old post on AskUbuntu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ubuntu---unbinding-keys&#34;&gt;Ubuntu - Unbinding Keys&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In settings, go to keyboard &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; keyboard shortcuts &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disable the &amp;ldquo;show the notification list&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;disable the &amp;ldquo;open the quick settings menu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will release the Super+V and Super+C keys for use in zed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;zed-keymaps&#34;&gt;Zed Keymaps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I mapped the keys in zed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34; data-lang=&#34;json&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// Zed keymap
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;//
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// For information on binding keys, see the Zed
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// documentation: https://zed.dev/docs/key-bindings
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;//
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// To see the default key bindings run `zed: open default keymap`
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// from the command palette.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;context&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Workspace&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;bindings&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// &amp;#34;shift shift&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;file_finder::Toggle&amp;#34;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  },

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ctrl-e&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;editor::MoveToEndOfLine&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;,

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  }
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE:  this is a snapshot as of this writing.  The actual up to date configs are in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/zed&#34;&gt;zed repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;linux-terminal&#34;&gt;Linux Terminal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the same basic &amp;ldquo;copy&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;paste&amp;rdquo; keys in the terminal, I did the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terminal &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; preferences &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Shortcuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;under Edit, map Paste to Super+V&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;under Edit, map Copy to Super+C&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Finally Got my Ham Radio License - and Whales!</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ham-radio/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 09 Jan 2025 09:30:29 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ham-radio/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I was trained as a US Navy ET.  Decades later I finally took my Ham Radio test.  I am now also known as K06HAX!  It&amp;rsquo;s a key step towards my whale song project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a geek when it comes to communications.  I dove into networking the first chance I got - back when Banyan Vines was the standard and the new upstart TCP/IP stuff was just coming into use in the corporate world.  I built out a spread-spectrum radio network in 1994-1995 way before the WiFi standard came into being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/no-radio.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not a &amp;ldquo;rag chew&amp;rdquo; kind of guy.  I&amp;rsquo;d rather do just about anything than sit and talk on a microphone to people on the other side of a radio.  Not my thing.  So there was never a real driving force to get my Ham license - other than the fact that my training and experience would make it an easy test to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-changed&#34;&gt;What Changed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go back to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-update/&#34;&gt;earlier posts about my whale song project&lt;/a&gt; I moved away from the SOFAR technology and started looking at different radio options.  And I fell into a rabit hole!  RF is a huge field.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been bouncing all around it trying to understand different fequency bands, antennas, and what bands one can transmit on.  It became clear to me that if I had my license I could experiment on many more bands.  And, if you know me at all, you know that my #1 priority is to LEARN so this wasn&amp;rsquo;t a shallow effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-it-difficult&#34;&gt;Was it Difficult?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.  For the technician test - the entry level - you need only really basic electronics understanding.  If you can identify basic components on a schematic and understand &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law&#34;&gt;Ohms Law&lt;/a&gt; then you have the technical parts covered.  The rest is regulations really, and that&amp;rsquo;s all memorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hamstudy.org/appstore&#34;&gt;Ham Study App&lt;/a&gt; and just drilled and drilled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hamstudy.org/appstore&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/hamstudy_square.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I could take the practice tests and get 85% or better I scheduled the test.  I did it online and passed the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-i-do-with-it&#34;&gt;What Can I do with it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am legally allowed to transmit on a lot of frequencies now, from down low to way above WiFi.  I can use some WiFi channels that are not allowed for general use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t be chatting with other Hams around the world, and I can&amp;rsquo;t see myself doing the contests for how distant of a contact one can make.  I can see myself learning &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code&#34;&gt;morse code&lt;/a&gt; and learning the basics of how to communicate in an emergency.  That has special appeal to me because my grandfather (William Ralph Hooper Sr) was a telegraph operator.  I grew up on stories of how fast he could relay and what a great &amp;ldquo;fist&amp;rdquo; he had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ralph-hooper-sr.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ralph Hooper Senior, as I remember him in his 70&#39;s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the real value for me is that I am legally allowed to transmit and experiment - within certain limits - so I can explore solutions to interesting problems.  Problems like a bouy signalling that it has collected whale song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;keeping-the-end-vision-in-mind&#34;&gt;Keeping the end vision in mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radio technology is super fun and interesting, but it&amp;rsquo;s a means to an end: solving a problem.  Science is increasingly finding that animals communicate more than we ever thought, and that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-024-04050-5/index.html&#34;&gt;AI will let us talk to animals&lt;/a&gt;.  This is exactly what I hope to happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/whale-tail.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Humpback whale in the Bay of Banderas, near Puerto Vallarta Mexico.  December 2023.  Photo by Greg Herlein&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the radio technology may provide a critical link.  If a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-song/&#34;&gt; &amp;ldquo;telephone system to the whales&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is going to happen, we need radio to get from where humans are to where the whales are.  With AI on a bouy with a transducer and a radio link to shore, we can build that telephone system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time to get some practical experience.  In the coming months I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing about building my own antennas and what I&amp;rsquo;m learning about &amp;ldquo;high frequency&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;very high frequency&amp;rdquo; communications - especially about digital modes and protocols.  There&amp;rsquo;s a ton of learning to do.  Thank goodness for my Navy ET training, which gave me a solid technical foundation for all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand by!  More to come!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The US Navy gave me a solid foundation in leadership and operational excellence.  But translating that into the business world requires a few more things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations1.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a blog version of a talk I gave in Cambridge UK on Wednesday November 20, 2024.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.socode.co.uk/?source=google.com&#34;&gt;SoCode&lt;/a&gt; hosted a meetup for local Engineering leaders and I was honored to be asked to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am the VP of Software Engineering at BrightSign.  My current responsibilities include our SaaS platform &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsn.cloud&#34;&gt;BSN.cloud&lt;/a&gt;, our desktop authoring software BrightAuthor:connected, and all of our Quality Engineering efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrightSign is probably the best media player company that you have never heard of.  We spun out of Roku circa 2009.  You see our players in action all over the place, including at most TV walls in major retailers, and as part of retail kiosks for Bose, Sonos, GoPro, etc.  We have players in many airports and train stations for both arrival and departure board applications as well as advertising.  We are also in many museums where our easy to use interactivity makes it simple to create rich media experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work and learn at some really fine companies.  Most of my experience has been around software that uses a high degree of networking, audio and video, cloud, and embedded systems.  I even got to work for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution with the folks who found the Titanic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations4.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my core leadership and Engineering foundations were set from my service in the US Navy Submarine Force.  I served on the USS Richard B. Russell, SSN-687.  During the Cold War my submarine was tasked with many classified missions. In that environment failure is not an option.  Everyone on my submarine was selected because they were among the best in an already elite submarine force.  That was a crucible of Engineering and Leadership that put me on course for my entire career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations5.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My management style was directly formed by my Navy experience, and I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to codify my beliefs in writing through this blog as well as documents at every company I&amp;rsquo;ve been at.  But recently I found the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Operational-Excellence-Submarine-Organization-ebook/dp/B01LQZIVX0/ref=sr_1_1&#34;&gt;Extreme Operational Excellence&lt;/a&gt; written by two former US Navy Submarine Commanding Officers.  This excellent book captures everything I was taught in one easy to read book.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously.  Just go read this book.  If you want to have a high-performance team, follow the guidance.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to rehash that book here.  You should just go read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations6.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just reading that book is not enough, especially if you are in a technology product development company.  And especially if you are trying to scale that company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, the Navy has some advantages.  They have foundations whose roots go back to before the time of my hero, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Nelson,_1st_Viscount_Nelson&#34;&gt;Lord Admiral Nelson&lt;/a&gt;.  As an aside, he was an amazing leader.  You won&amp;rsquo;t go far wrong reading about hims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the Navy has fully formed foundations around mission, organizational structure, and a rigorous system to ensure that leaders learn what they need to learn at every level of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations7.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To have a high-performance team everyone has to understand the mission.  They also must believe the mission, and trust the leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mission of a submarine is easy to understand:  don&amp;rsquo;t let the other guys hear you before you hear them.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get blown up.  If needed, blow up the other guy and then get away.  That&amp;rsquo;s an amazingly easy mission to understand.  And it&amp;rsquo;s very clear what every single person onboard needs to do in order to support the mission.  In a company, that can be harder.  It&amp;rsquo;s critical that leadership explain the mission to the entire company.  What are our goals?  Why are we doing things?  How do we know we are doing well?  This requires a constant effort at communications up and down the whole organization.  Submarines have an even more important mission: don&amp;rsquo;t let the water come into the people tank.  Even in peacetime, the ocean will exploit any weakness.  At depth, you have to be focussed. Make the number of times you dive equal to the number of times you surface!  And of course, do the sometimes very secret things you are tasked with.  In a small company, what&amp;rsquo;s your mission?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it also requires that the mission be believable.  In industry, my personal rule is to never work at a company that makes a product I won&amp;rsquo;t buy with my own money.  If I don&amp;rsquo;t want the product it&amp;rsquo;s going to be hard to be believable to my team.  At BrightSign I totally believe in the product:  when I was at PRN years ago I bought many thousands of BrightSign players for a major deployment.  I still think we have the best solution on the market.  That&amp;rsquo;s easy for me to convey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust.  That&amp;rsquo;s the other side of believable.  The team has to trust the leadership.  Nothing takes the wind out of a team&amp;rsquo;s sails like not trusting the leaders.  If they don&amp;rsquo;t trust you then you will never have a high performing team.  Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations8.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Navy has an enormous advantage of having solved their optimum organization structure.  A ship has a number of divisions.  Several divisions form a department.  There are several departments that form the crew.  Every division has an officer (manager) and every division has a higher-ranking officer (department head).  The crew has an XO and a CO (like a VP and a President, kinda).  The enlisted crew have a structure of subject matter experts who are leaders &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_petty_officer#:~:text=Chief%20petty%20officer%20is%20an,as%20senior%20non%2Dcommissioned%20officers&#34;&gt;(Chiefs)&lt;/a&gt; and a time-proven hierarchy of workers.  Every ship follows that.  You scale up to a fleet by adding another layer of management (Admirals).  This organizational structure has been field proven over hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies have to design their organizational structure.  There are some common structures, sure.  But especially when the company is smaller the structure is a lot less rigid.  If nothing else, there just are not enough employees to organize perfectly.  Folks are working across disciplines, wearing many hats.  There&amp;rsquo;s no playbook developed over hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideal of org structure planning is to write a chart of boxes that are roles and don&amp;rsquo;t put any names in them.  Don&amp;rsquo;t think about the staff you have, just think about the best way to organize around the work.  Be acutely aware of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law&#34;&gt;Conway&amp;rsquo;s Law&lt;/a&gt;: you will ship your org chart.  If you have a team that works on several parts of your product you are likely to see that neither part is fully baked.  I could talk for hours about this, but there are plenty of books on this already.  Just keep it in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But&amp;hellip; people.  In small companies we always have people that are high performers.  People you trust to tackle the hard problem, to not just give up.  There&amp;rsquo;s often no time to manage the details, and your trusted right hand is who you turn to.  That&amp;rsquo;s just how it is.  That&amp;rsquo;s going to impact how you organize.  You may find that your practical day to day operating organization does not match the org chart on paper as a result.  If that&amp;rsquo;s the case, consider changing the on-paper formal chart to reflect the reality.  Your team knows the real structure anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations9.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality of smaller companies is that you need to staff them more like a professional sports team.  You need the best talent you can afford, and you need to structure your game plan to take best advantage of the players you have.  A former manager of mine once said that the ultimate goal of a larger company is to be able to fill every role with a mediocre talent.  If you are a small or even medium-sized company you cannot compete unless you have the talent.  One can argue that in high-growth, high tech companies that you can never accept just mediocre staff either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge you have to always consider is that you cannot scale with just superstars.  Well, I suppose if you are the Yankees or Dodgers (I HATE the Dodgers) and have bottomless buckets of money you can try.  But for the mere mortal companies, at some point you have to start using a smart org structure and rely less on the superstars.  This is always going to be case by case.  Just realize that you can&amp;rsquo;t just go hire another Alex Morgan/Barry Bonds/Joe Montana/whoever.  You have to build a whole TEAM, and you have to organize them well.  Otherwise you just can&amp;rsquo;t scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations10.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Navy has an incredibly well structured (and rigid) promotion process.  Officers on a submarine must be a division officer, then a department head.  They must do each of the department head roles (Weapons, Navigation, Engineering, etc.).  Then they must go special schools to learn to be an XO and then a CO.  The Navy has created a formal structure for leadership. You can&amp;rsquo;t change it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies don&amp;rsquo;t have that at all.  It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly common for the trusted folks (see above) to be promoted several levels.  In the Navy you would never promote a division officer to XO, skipping the experience of being a department head.  But we see it all the time in small tech companies that a team lead is suddenly a VP of Engineering, or a co-founder coder is CTO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to scale your company cleanly, you need leaders who understand the job of all the levels below them.  Not &amp;ldquo;read a book&amp;rdquo; understand, but &amp;ldquo;been there and done that&amp;rdquo; understand.  Folks who skip levels rarely succeed.  Please go read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Pipeline-Developing-Leaders-Digital-ebook/dp/B0CV6T46PJ/ref=sr_1_1&#34;&gt;Leadership Pipeline&lt;/a&gt;.  Learn what lessons are needed at each level.  Then if you need to break the rules and skip a level you at least are aware of the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management is a skill.  It requires learning and practice.  It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly common that Engineers don&amp;rsquo;t really understand that.  There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect&#34;&gt;Dunning-Kruger Effect&lt;/a&gt; where folks just don&amp;rsquo;t know what they don&amp;rsquo;t know.  I half joke that most Engineers are least somewhere along the autism spectrum - we often vastly prefer computers to people.  In fact, it seems like many Engineers are just baffled by people, or assume that other people are just like them.  People skills need to be developed.  And unless you learn people skills AND how to manage, you will not do well at it.  If you need to have folks skip a level (or worse, two) then I strongly suggest paying for a leadership coach.  You can pay now, or pay a lot more later when the lack of management skill undercuts the foundation of your company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/foundations/foundations11.png&#34; width=&#34;75%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a strong foundation and things get shaky then it can go terribly wrong.  Whether that&amp;rsquo;s a business change, growing too fast, COVID, or a natural disaster, you rely on your foundation.  This photo is of a house in my home city of San Francisco.  Homes near this one with a stronger foundation didn&amp;rsquo;t have this level of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with planning and effort you don&amp;rsquo;t have to suffer.  You can have a strong foundation and weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then if you use the principles in the books above you can scale and have a truly high-performance Engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.socode.co.uk/?source=google.com&#34;&gt;SoCode&lt;/a&gt; for asking me to speak at their meetup.  I&amp;rsquo;ve used them for recruiting for the last several years.  They are easily the best recruiters I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with.  I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend them highly enough.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Long Time No Post! RPi Pico, Zephyr, and Whales (oh my)</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/long-time-no-post/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Oct 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A short update on my whale song project:  I fell down a few technical rabbit hole!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in May I &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-new-tech/&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; that my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-song/&#34;&gt;whale song project&lt;/a&gt; was delayed to change the underlying technology.  Whew!  It&amp;rsquo;s been an adventure to learn a bunch of new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/rabbit-hole.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all in my spare time, so progress has been much slower than I would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-not-arduino&#34;&gt;Why Not Arduino?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some folks might wonder why I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t just use arduino - even use micropython.  I could.  I might even get a fully working single buoy out made.  It probably would be a fine way to prototype it all, since nearly every sensor has drivers.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do that for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to learn how the lower level technology works - my goal is not to get &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; working as fast as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even if I did get a fast prototype done, I would STILL have to do the work later to make it scalable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, off I went down the technical rabblit hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;tinygo&#34;&gt;TinyGo?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like golang - a lot.  So I wanted to try &lt;a href=&#34;https://tinygo.org/&#34;&gt;TinyGo&lt;/a&gt;.  It was ridiculously easy to get started.  The community around seems strong.  But very quickly I found that many of the sensor chips I wanted to use were not supported yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, maybe too new.  What ecosystem has a lot of support?  Enter Zephyr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;zephyr&#34;&gt;Zephyr?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the buzz is around the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr&#34;&gt;Zephyr RTOS ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;.  Huge.  Like, it&amp;rsquo;s overtaking FreeRTOS (which makes me wonder if Amazon made a mistake buying FreeRTOS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone told me it had a very steep learning curve.  My initial research dove into device trees (different than Linux device trees) and kconfig (seems to be pretty much like linux kconfig) and a dizzying array of configuration options.  Yes, the learning curve feels like a steep mountain peak in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/steep-mountain.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I set Zephyr aside and looked for something I could approach more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;raspberry-pi-pico&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi Pico&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fell in love with this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/&#34;&gt;controller&lt;/a&gt;.  I have decided not to use it for this project, but damn I love it.  Here&amp;rsquo;s some things I really like about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;incredible documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FAST - 133MHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dual core&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;European company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;widely adopted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;programmable with another pico or the cheap &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/debug-probe/&#34;&gt;picoprobe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;did I mention the great docs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really got into this part.  I even built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/pico-template&#34;&gt;template repository on github&lt;/a&gt; that makes it much easier to set up a new project for this board.  I&amp;rsquo;m specifically referring to using this with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk&#34;&gt;Pico SDK&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a bare-metal C/C++ SDK that is simply amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really, really love this part.  So why did I set it aside?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-the-ecosystem-stupid-its-me-thats-stupid&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the Ecosystem, Stupid (it&amp;rsquo;s me that&amp;rsquo;s stupid)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to learn that the most important thing you should consider about choosing microcontrollers is the ecosysystem - specifically, how many drivers exist for it, and how much energy is in the system by chip vendors.  I spent a pile of time trying to port drivers to the Pico and&amp;hellip; well, darn.  It takes a LOT of time, and frankly is not what I most like to do.  Digging around in the registers of a new chip isn&amp;rsquo;t my cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried integrationg an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/pico-imulib&#34;&gt;IMU&lt;/a&gt; and also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/pico-pong&#34;&gt;LoRa radio&lt;/a&gt;.  I found myself spending all my time - what very small time I have for this project - doing things that are simply not core to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also discovered that many of the drivers easily available are from chips from 2-5 years ago.  And some (many?) of those are &amp;ldquo;not recommended for new designs.&amp;rdquo;  Some are flat out no longer being made (though are actively cloned).  The chips I would want to put into a product I&amp;rsquo;d make next year are simply not supported yet.  Makes sense, if you think about it.  The open source ecosystem supports what is already mainstream, and the drivers mature enough to be in the SDK examples are going to be for older stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided, reluctantly, to shift directions. Despite loving the SDK, the lack of drivers had me using all my time trying to create them. But it&amp;rsquo;s almost November and that means it&amp;rsquo;s almost time for the whales to migrate south again and&amp;hellip;  I don&amp;rsquo;t have a thing to put in the water.  I can&amp;rsquo;t even talk to the sensor chips I want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, this rabbit hole gets deeper.  It&amp;rsquo;s not just a change in SDK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;zephyr-1&#34;&gt;Zephyr!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things slowing me down were lack of drivers for newer chips. Zephyr has support for many of those newer chips.  So I bit the bullet and did enough experimenting that I got a variety of &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blinky&amp;rdquo; working on the Pico.  Yay!  Super fun.  The things that were simple in the SDK took some work in Zephyr - like making the Pico Probe work.  But I plowed ahead and made it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I had a way to tak to sensors, I needed a radio.  Specifically, I need a radio link that I can use to (eventually) take a boat to get near a whale recording bouy and download the song.  Ideally it could tell me over a long-range radio that it actually had data for me to collect.  So I was looking at a LoRa radio for alerting and either WiFi or Bluetooth for data transfer.  The Pico W has a radio on the board already integrated and my casual testing showed it worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s when I hit a brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/brick-wall.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do anything that isn&amp;rsquo;t super basic with the Pico radio under Zephyr was going to be either impossible, or take a lot of time.  I was back at that same point I was at with the Pico SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can definitely understand why folks trying to &amp;ldquo;move up&amp;rdquo; to more professional tooling for embedded systems give up and just go back to Arduino.  Damn, this stuff is hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-nordic&#34;&gt;Enter Nordic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should have been obvious to me from day one, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nordicsemi.com/About-us&#34;&gt;Nordic Semiconductor&lt;/a&gt; is THE vedor that has the best support in Zephyr.  They integrated it into their entire toolchain.  They have whole swaths of training videos.  All aimed at their chips, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in for a penny in for a pound!  I bought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DDQ71LR6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;3 pack of nRF52840-based boards by Seeed Studio&lt;/a&gt; and got to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An things worked pretty much out of the box.  Of course, by this time I was already a lot more familiar with Zephyr and that helped.  I did have to dig around in my parts bin for a J-Link probe, and I had to buy a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO-Expansion-Board/&#34;&gt;Seeed Studio Expansion Base Board&lt;/a&gt; to expose the SWD pins.  More learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now an entire universe of radio options opens up to me, include &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_mesh_networking&#34;&gt;Bluetooth Mesh&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s possible that over water, with some directional antennas I could string a set of bouys together in a mesh.  If that works, I would not even need to go out in a boat to get the wale song recordings.  I might solve a Phase 2 problem in Phase 1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It does sometimes feel like I&amp;rsquo;m just sprialling, but as long as I a getting closer and closer to a solution it&amp;rsquo;s fine!  And as long as I&amp;rsquo;m learning, it&amp;rsquo;s totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/spiral.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is there a bottom to this rabbit hole?  We can only move forward and fine out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;playing-with-tinygo-aagain&#34;&gt;Playing with TinyGo Aagain?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I am in a spiral of sorts.  In the months I was learning all this a whole bunch of new sensors/drivers were added to TinyGo.  If I get some time I may go back and play there, just for fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what happens when you are more interested in learning than actually completing a project.  But the whales only migrate once a year, so at some point I need to get something in the water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Leaving this here mostly for me, but short instructions on how to install Pulseview on Linux to use cheap logic analyzers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone Logic analyzers that use the Cypress FX2 chips are readily available for cheap - like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077LSG5P2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title&#34;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon.  But to set them up on Linux is a few steps and I seem to always have to hunt down the exact steps.  So I&amp;rsquo;m noting them here for my future self and anyone else that needs them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;libsigrok&#34;&gt;Libsigrok&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you will need the basic library - AND the udev rules that go with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clone the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sigrok.org/wiki/Libsigrok&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;git clone  git://sigrok.org/libsigrok&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;install the dependencies (these are for Ubuntu/Debian/Mint)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo apt-get install git-core gcc g++ make autoconf autoconf-archive &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  automake libtool pkg-config libglib2.0-dev libglibmm-2.4-dev libzip-dev &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  libusb-1.0-0-dev libftdi1-dev libieee1284-3-dev libvisa-dev nettle-dev libavahi-client-dev &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  libhidapi-dev check doxygen python3-numpy python3-dev python-gi-dev python3-setuptools-git swig default-jdk
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build and install&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;./configure
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;make
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo make install
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the udev files as described &lt;a href=&#34;https://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - you should read those steps.  For me this was the following from the libsigrok directory:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo cp contrib/60-libsigrok.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo cp contrib/61-libsigrok-plugdev.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo udevadm trigger
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last step is required to reload the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-the-firmware&#34;&gt;Install the Firmware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic analyzer is useless without the firmware that should be loaded onto it when it&amp;rsquo;s plugged into your USB port.  From a folder you can clone into, you need to get these files into the right spot like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo apt install sdcc
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone git://sigrok.org/sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd sigrok-firmware-fx2lafw
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;./autogen.sh
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;./configure
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;make
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo make install
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-pulseview&#34;&gt;Install Pulseview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had bad luck with the Debian/Ubuntu builds.  The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s reliably worked for me is the nightly appimage builds, available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://sigrok.org/wiki/Downloads&#34;&gt;this download page&lt;/a&gt;.  For me, I used the Linux 64 bit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;wget https://sigrok.org/download/binary/pulseview/pulseview-NIGHTLY-x86_64-debug.appimage
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mv pulseview-NIGHTLY-x86_64-debug.appimage ~/bin
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd ~/bin
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ln -s ./pulseview-NIGHTLY-x86_64-debug.appimage ./pulseview
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;chmod +x pulseview
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is assuming you are setup to run appimages and ~/bin is in your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-pulseview&#34;&gt;Run Pulseview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the CLI you can now just type &amp;ldquo;pulseview&amp;rdquo; and it will start.  If all went well you will see that it autodetected the device &amp;ldquo;Saleae Logic&amp;rdquo; instead of &amp;ldquo;Demo Device&amp;rdquo; - like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/pulseview.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enjoy&#34;&gt;Enjoy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to use a logic analyzer is an exercise for the reader.  But &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/using-the-usb-logic-analyzer-with-sigrok-pulseview/all&#34;&gt;Sparkfun has a tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that is likely very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changing Chrome Address Bar Suggestions</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/chrome-predictor/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Leaving this here mostly for me, but short instructions on how to change Chrome&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;typeahead&amp;rdquo; predictors if it remembers the &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chrome &amp;ldquo;remembers&amp;rdquo; where you visit and uses that as a &amp;ldquo;typeahead&amp;rdquo; shortcut.  I use this all the time. Sometimes if you do a lot with one location it remembers THAT one but it&amp;rsquo;s not the general one you really want to be remembered.  And I&amp;rsquo;m always forgetting how to clear it.  So here&amp;rsquo;s a note to my future self, and anyone else who it can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:  hightlight the offending URL in the address bar, and then press:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mac: Shift+FN+Delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linux and Windows: Shift + Delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chromebook: Alt + Shift + Delete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a full on article on this &lt;a href=&#34;https://osxdaily.com/2021/10/22/how-delete-chrome-url-links-address-bar/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and of course also an online answer &lt;a href=&#34;https://superuser.com/questions/1399929/how-can-you-modify-url-predictions-on-chrome/1402013#1402013&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review:  Managing Priorities</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/review-priorities/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/review-priorities/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting several years for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrymax/&#34;&gt;Harry Max&lt;/a&gt; to finish his book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Priorities-Create-Smarter-Decisions/dp/1959029002/ref=sr_1_2?crid=5RQEJRH5KZAI&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q9_X01U27T2lnwDdjFqJSE2rqArkTPV1esytqE8l3Bc7TKJSiX6Rh-kr7FeoIITrH1GaTFRXGwxdBcdgT_bLdeQ3IbNHLhYIa7NcKa7m0NrqytaNF3yhEQfCWbf8YVZMklfYWig5Ip5E6t6RSRlVXqp8Zc43Bh2nf7gQ0WcTK-okoqiOmewIcABEPY7oCgrHwUXO6eLIn197t79hpJU8EJyRNAioit0SAJr2CF59mI4.2XCGLy2oiRuC7NeiQyJYzuAtTFFSV2_5jB04CgaQ9yA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=managing+priorities&amp;qid=1717763474&amp;sprefix=managing+prioritie%2Caps%2C136&amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Managing Priorities&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s available, and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome!  Some observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caveat:  I know the author.  I consider him a friend who I don&amp;rsquo;t get to see nearly enough.  I worked with Harry at Rackspace and would do nearly anything to work with him again.  He&amp;rsquo;s one of the people I would add to my &amp;ldquo;Dream Team&amp;rdquo; if I could.  He&amp;rsquo;s easily one of the smartest, wisest people I know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was clearly excited that he finally finished his book &amp;ldquo;Managing Priorities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Priorities-Create-Smarter-Decisions/dp/1959029002/ref=sr_1_2?crid=5RQEJRH5KZAI&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.q9_X01U27T2lnwDdjFqJSE2rqArkTPV1esytqE8l3Bc7TKJSiX6Rh-kr7FeoIITrH1GaTFRXGwxdBcdgT_bLdeQ3IbNHLhYIa7NcKa7m0NrqytaNF3yhEQfCWbf8YVZMklfYWig5Ip5E6t6RSRlVXqp8Zc43Bh2nf7gQ0WcTK-okoqiOmewIcABEPY7oCgrHwUXO6eLIn197t79hpJU8EJyRNAioit0SAJr2CF59mI4.2XCGLy2oiRuC7NeiQyJYzuAtTFFSV2_5jB04CgaQ9yA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=managing+priorities&amp;qid=1717763474&amp;sprefix=managing+prioritie%2Caps%2C136&amp;sr=8-2&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/managing-priorities.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Managing Priorities book cover&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-i-love-it&#34;&gt;Why Do I Love It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a blueprint, but it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s the one true way.&amp;rdquo;  Yes, he has a framework (&amp;ldquo;DEGAP&amp;rdquo;) but it reminds me of scrum, really.  It&amp;rsquo;s a skeleton of how to organize but not overly proscriptive.  What keeps jumping out at me is how he describes sixteen (16) specific methods of actually doing the work of prioritizing.  He summarizes them in Appendix A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that sounds dry&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s not!  Clean, simple writing with succinct explanations.  All told via the narrative of how Harry came to this wisdom with real stories - especially from his time at Rackspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book on how to think as much as anything.  And Harry is a master thinker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-specific-thoughts&#34;&gt;Some Specific Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;priorities-have-a-shelf-life&#34;&gt;Priorities Have a Shelf Life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that heading on page 133 hit me like the proverbial two-by-four over the head.  Of course.  But it&amp;rsquo;s true!  &amp;ldquo;Revisit top-level priorities once a month&amp;rdquo; (or more frequently even) is great guidance, and one that I hope to implement in my current organization.  How often do you actually revisit your top level priorities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing Harry makes a solid point of is intentionality.  He leads off with that guidance in Chapter 3 and comes back to it often.  Be intentional about constantly prioritizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-urgency-wins&#34;&gt;When Urgency Wins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Focusing on short-term results can lead to a nasty trap.&amp;rdquo;  Yes.  So easy to say.  And you are reading this saying &amp;ldquo;yes, yes, I already know that.&amp;rdquo;  But what do you do if you are in that trap, with the teeth of the bear trap almost ripping your foot off at the ankle?  As I was reading this book I could see a way to get out of the trap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;priority-number-ones&#34;&gt;Priority Number One(s)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where new Priority-Ones keep coming down the pike, but the older ones don&amp;rsquo;t go away.  So you never really shift priorities.  You just now have a new one too.&amp;rdquo;  How many of you have had that happen?  If you do software today you can&amp;rsquo;t tell me that&amp;rsquo;s not happened.  If you can honestly say no then maybe I want to come work in your org!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/speedboat.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harry&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Speedboat&amp;rdquo; analysis approach may be the way out of that mess.  Read Chapter 11!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;max-priorities-pyramid&#34;&gt;Max Priorities Pyramid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapter 11 &amp;ldquo;Sustaining Team Success&amp;rdquo; is where the meat was on the bone for me.  Harry lays out the &amp;ldquo;Max Priorities Pyramid&amp;rdquo; which also captures how servicing any higher level goal has to account for process automation, tech debt, defects, and yes&amp;hellip; the features.  This graphical way of INCLUDING those key workstreams is powerful.  It&amp;rsquo;s a way to draw a picture where all can see that those things are KEY PARTS of the prioritization.  Too often those are shunted aside in favor of just &amp;ldquo;implement the new feature.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/max-pyramid.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;catchball&#34;&gt;Catchball&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The idea is that no proposed priority starts from the top and ends in a Plan of Record without traveling down and back up the chain of command.&amp;rdquo;  The organization being active in a feedback loop in setting priorities is key.  After reading that sentence it&amp;rsquo;s OBVIOUS how powerful that is, but this small section of the book (starts on page 178!) resonated with me as an ACTIONABLE process that fills a gap I have too often seen:  management sets prioriites in a vacuum and the feedback loop happens during implementation in real time.  And product velocity slows.  And morale lowers.  And customers wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/catchball.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An argument against most of what Harry describes will be &amp;ldquo;we don&amp;rsquo;t have the time for that!&amp;rdquo;  What, you think you have time to do it over when you find out you worked on the wrong things?  I have a saying:  &amp;ldquo;sometimes you have to slow down to go faster later.&amp;rdquo;  Getting your priorities right - and agreed to up, down and across your organization, is key.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t do that you will be like a little ball in a pachinko machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/pachinko.jpg&#34; width=&#34;30%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this book.  Heed his wisdom.  I am going to make all my leaders read this, and try like crazy to get every product leader I know read it too.  This book is destined to be a classic.  It cannot help but make you better at building products - or better at whatever you set out to do.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun being interviewed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/aimeevincent-bunn/&#34;&gt;Aimee Vincent-Bunn&lt;/a&gt; who hosts the fabulous &lt;a href=&#34;https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/women-in-stem10/episodes/In-conversation-with-Greg-Herlein---WiSTEM-e2kfoev/a-abb1pkq&#34;&gt;Women in STEM&lt;/a&gt; podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over half of all graduates of STEM programs are women.  Why aren&amp;rsquo;t half of all Engineers female?  Aimee and I discuss this and more on her fabulous podcast.  Available here:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I decided to learn how to write gRPC code in golang - and used ChatGPT as an accelerator! Jump to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/time-services&#34;&gt;writeup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/time-services&#34;&gt;writeup on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; lays out the details.  Not much point in repeating it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea is to do three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;refresh my understanding of golang development (especially &amp;ldquo;modern go&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;learn how to use autogenerated code for gRPC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;see how much ChatGPT can help me in this process&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the README on GitHub for all the details!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Book Review: AI at the Edge</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I bought the eBook &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/AI-at-Edge-Daniel-Situnayake-ebook/dp/B0BS2FKXW4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2Y7H35NZX1T2X&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YVcaIOeDUrnPaRKjlIpqDw2xPbpbIllMK3yBWW7GIwXNftlBZIiFDjxBMPwvShuig7DwSNZKIYrbmAuTh5DRoooK8XBRw_r_i7t1MFsEY8mQ56E4dJJ_0erV7loifhGYrEKKxi-EcCotUXv_HabTTeXOaKO_LdIJd6Aqu8FEf2SoBMYOifAq9FLYbn8KM9ydkYNilUpKBT_GwejxKml66IBAGFS0uzO3BjL2EbRLwwA.xV0rgNEiT9qpdTnArFldlPvQh-1lXGI7FePn60wrYJo&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=ai+at+the+edge&amp;qid=1716340331&amp;sprefix=ai+at+the+edge%2Caps%2C149&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;AI at the Edge&lt;/a&gt;.  But you can download a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/edgeimpulse_edge-impulse-unleashing-intelligent-solutions-activity-7188548497820848129-VmpI&#34;&gt;free copy&lt;/a&gt; from LinkedIn.  In short?  Don&amp;rsquo;t waste your money.  But for free?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cut-to-the-chase&#34;&gt;Cut To The Chase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t waste your money.  I am not even sure this book is worth your time if you get the free download.  Read more for why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/edgeimpulse_edge-impulse-unleashing-intelligent-solutions-activity-7188548497820848129-VmpI&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ai-at-the-edge.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;70%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-was-i-reading-this&#34;&gt;Why Was I Reading This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day job is all about Edge Devices.  And the world is full of the promise of AI.  And my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-song/&#34;&gt;whale song project&lt;/a&gt;.  So of course I am interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-the-book-is&#34;&gt;What the Book Is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LinkedIn blurb about this book say this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;AI at the Edge&amp;rsquo; guide is a practical compass for engineers, product managers, and tech leaders.
Discover how Edge AI transforms IoT devices, harnessing previously discarded sensor data. This guide
is your end-to-end companion, navigating data collection, model optimization, and beyond. Edge AI is
not just a tool; it&amp;rsquo;s a roadmap for solving real-world problems responsibly and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three chapters with examples on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ai-at-the-edge&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 11 Code: Use Case: Wildlife Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 12 Code: Use Case: Food Quality Assurance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter 13 Code: Use Case: Consumer Products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-this-book-isnt&#34;&gt;What This Book Isn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this book isn&amp;rsquo;t a very practical book.  There&amp;rsquo;s realy no AI here that I see - that isn&amp;rsquo;t hidden behind a proprietary tool.  The examples mandate the use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://edgeimpulse.com/&#34;&gt;Edge Impuse Studio&lt;/a&gt;.  This should have been really called out up front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three examples - and a lot of the overall theme of the book - is a cookie-cutter &amp;ldquo;follow the template&amp;rdquo; approach that is really short on details.  This book would have been vastly better in my opinion had it focussed on one example and really done it well.  Then the details could have been really explored.  Algorithms.  Libraries.  HOW to clean the data.  Almost anything other than telling me AGAIN the overll process flow they recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was really disappointing was the lack of &amp;ldquo;edge&amp;rdquo; in this book.  The whole point of edge is embedded systems and this book dodged that.  Sure, there was some discussion.  All talk.  I would have loved to see that one example and go into the choice of hardware and interfacing and data collection.  Using a mobile phone is really cheating.  That&amp;rsquo;s really not edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the cover this is an O&amp;rsquo;Reilly book.  I bought it for that reason.  I trust them.  Well, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-opinion&#34;&gt;My Opinion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a marketing book by Edge Impulse.  The whole point seems to be to drive folks to their tooling.  Please ignore the man behind the curtain and all that.  O&amp;rsquo;Reilly usually does better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d ask for my money back if I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE:  this is my own opinion.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure ohers found tis book useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developing Leaders in the post-COVID Era</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/lol/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a &amp;ldquo;leader-of-leaders&amp;rdquo; for a long time. It&amp;rsquo;s changed post-covid.  But when I talk to some Engineers about the difference between &amp;ldquo;Leader of Others&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Leader of Leaders&amp;rdquo; they don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.  So I thought I&amp;rsquo;d blog about it, and maybe even learn more myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-best-book-on-leadership-to-me&#34;&gt;The Best Book on Leadership (to me)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first became a Director my boss made me read this book and we would discuss it in our 1:1 meetings.  It&amp;rsquo;s the single best book I have read on Leadership in the business world.  I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Pipeline-Developing-Leaders-Digital-dp-1394160976/dp/1394160976/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/leadership-pipeline-cover.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-leader-of-leader-role&#34;&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Leader-of-Leader&amp;rdquo; Role&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;LoL&amp;rdquo; role is not &amp;ldquo;laugh out loud,&amp;rdquo; but sometimes it can make you do that.  Sometimes it can make you want to cry too.  It certainly can also make you feel tremendously proud and grateful.  I don&amp;rsquo;t see enough discussion about the role, frankly.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations on this topic over the last few months with a variety of people.  It seemed like a good idea to write some notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &amp;ldquo;Leader-of-Others&amp;rdquo; is the first rung of the management ladder.  what I call a &amp;ldquo;Line Manager&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;People Manager.&amp;rdquo;  This person is supervising and developing others directly.  This is the first real role in management.  Transitioning to that role is difficult for many since some folks get promoted to manager because they are great Engineers.  That&amp;rsquo;s not enough.  Management is a completely new skill and has goals and activities that are sometimes orthogonal to what one does as an Engineer. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager of those managers is a &amp;ldquo;Leader-of-Leaders.&amp;rdquo;  In tech the typical LoL job titles can span from &amp;ldquo;Senior Manager&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Director&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;Vice President&amp;rdquo; depending on the size of the team and the span of control.  The single absolute requirement is that this role manages other managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that changes the game completely.  It&amp;rsquo;s the first place in the chain where the &amp;ldquo;people stuff&amp;rdquo; matters more than the &amp;ldquo;technical stuff.&amp;rdquo;  Not that LoL&amp;rsquo;s are not technical.  In my opinion, the best ones are quite technical.  But the actual work done weekly - and the skills to do that work - is drastically different than the work of an Engineer and a Line Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absolutely wonderful book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Pipeline-Developing-Leaders-Digital-dp-1394160976/dp/1394160976/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&#34;&gt;Leadership Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; has a short passage that sums it up best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/quote.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Chapter 4 - Leading Leaders - Page 81 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They are supposed to select and develop the leaders-of-others and hold them accountable for leading.&amp;rdquo;  Wow.  What does that really mean?  And how has that changed in the post-COVID era?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;selecting-and-developing-leaders-of-others&#34;&gt;Selecting and Developing Leaders-of-Others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have developed an alergic reaction to the term &amp;ldquo;hold them accountable.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s just got a ring of &amp;ldquo;fire them&amp;rdquo; to it.  Yes, at the end of the day if someone cannot develop into the role then you have to either move them into a new role or yes, move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you get to that point, the &amp;ldquo;blame&amp;rdquo; lies on the LoL, not on on the Line Manager.  But &amp;ldquo;blame isn&amp;rsquo;t the right concept. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/about/&#34;&gt;management style&lt;/a&gt; tries to operate a blameless culture. So it&amp;rsquo;s not really blame.  It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;responsibility.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LoL is responsible to ensure that the line managers are being effective.  Just as important, the LoL is responsible for recruiting, selecting and training the managers.  The &amp;ldquo;pipeline&amp;rdquo; of folks to be managers does not happen by accident.  It happens through planning and development and a recruiting process that is not transactional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So really &amp;ldquo;holding them accountable&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;doing the daily job of being a Leader-of-Leaders.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s really &amp;ldquo;holding yourself responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;detecting-when-line-managers-are-struggling&#34;&gt;Detecting When Line Managers are Struggling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Pipeline-Developing-Leaders-Digital-dp-1394160976/dp/1394160976/ref=dp_ob_title_bk&#34;&gt;Leadership                                    &lt;br&gt;
Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; enough.  So I&amp;rsquo;m going to quote it a lot here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/issues.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Chapter 3 - Typical Transition Issues - Page 69 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A LoL must be extremely aware of these typical issues and be ready to coach the manager through them.  The fundamental problem is that a new manager is usually a very good Engineer, and it&amp;rsquo;s human nature to lean on those skills instead of developing the new skills of being a manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for the LoL to be able to coach the manager through this transition they need to have done it themselves. When the LoL was a manager if they didn&amp;rsquo;t learn to delegate, didn&amp;rsquo;t learn to be comfortable letting Engineers arrive at solutions themselves, didn&amp;rsquo;t master the skills of being an effective manager then how do they coach and mentor new managers through that transition?  And what if that LoL didn&amp;rsquo;t spend enough time (or any time) as a manager before becoming an LoL?  This happens a lot in fast-growing teams, especially founders or early start Engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most common problem I have seen - and something the book covers extensively.  If the LoL didn&amp;rsquo;t develop these skills then he or she is going to be blind to the problem.  Often the LoL just reverts back to the behavior they did as a manager or star Engineer and the whole team structure comes apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timescales&#34;&gt;Timescales&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My observation is that line managers can make changes in work breakdown, assignments, coaching of a person, etc. and actually see results in a matter of days or weeks.  The atomic unit of time for a change is pretty much one sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The atomic unit of change that an LoL can make is going to be much, much longer.  Probably multiple sprints.  If that LoL is expecting changes too soon they are probably doing the work of a manager.  That may be needed in an emergency, but if the organization is going to scale and grow then the LoL needs to coach the manager to make the needed changes.  And it likely isn&amp;rsquo;t just that one manager that needs it.  You should be asking yourself &amp;ldquo;is this systemic?  Do I need a process to make this standard across my teams?&amp;rdquo;  Writing that process, training folks on it, and getting it in place is NOT something that happens in days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can slam it in place, sure.  But then you have to slam it again as your teams grow, or you add another team.  Scaling out means adding just the right amount of process.  THAT is what an LoL needs to be thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are moving towards being an LoL (or working for one) you should always ask &amp;ldquo;what timescale do we think this can be done in?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the higher up the rungs you go, the longer the timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lol-responsibilities&#34;&gt;LoL Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Leaders of Leaders translate strategy into operational plans.&amp;rdquo;  That&amp;rsquo;s the work.  That and mentoring and developing managers.  Note:  I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention writing code.  Or designing system architecture.  No code reviews.  This is where it gets mushy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good LoL needs to be able to dive down when needed.  They may not be specialists but they should have enough experience that they can spot (or smell) things that don&amp;rsquo;t look right.  They ask questions and especially ask the teams to explain their thinking and how they arrived at answers.  But that really is the manager&amp;rsquo;s job.  The LoL should be observing and coaching the managers to do that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And more importantly, the LoL should be spending time across the company/organization to really understand the business strategy and how the technology aligns to that.  Then he or she should be working with the managers and senior Engineers to break down the goals and map them to how to build the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area where I am currently weak is not getting too much into the weeds on system architecture.  I LOVE system architecture and I think I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty good at it.  And my current company is fairly lean on staffing verses the large amount of code and functionality we support and plan to build.  So I find myself dropping into that role more than I should.  That&amp;rsquo;s not bad but it&amp;rsquo;s not good either.  Seeing this in myself means I really must be pushing the right people on my team towards that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important attributes of a LoL is self-inspection.  Humility.  The abililty to say &amp;ldquo;I was wrong.&amp;rdquo;  And especially taking extra steps to &amp;ldquo;farm dissent.&amp;rdquo;  When the LoL is also the most experienced and best Engineer and starts to act like that then you are headed into dangerous territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-covid-era&#34;&gt;Post-COVID Era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My original premise: how does all this change in a post-COVID era?  The short answer is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  The longer answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder to do well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developing junior Engineers is going to be a LOT harder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;having an org with a lot of junior Engineers &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; an LoL that didn&amp;rsquo;t learn to be a manager well is a bigger trap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;harder-to-do-well&#34;&gt;Harder to Do Well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a word:  remote.  Other than some companies being obstinate about return to office (RTO) the new reality is that we work at least some (most?) remote now.  Especially the younger Engineers.  During COVID we told them they could study and work from home so they didn&amp;rsquo;t get sick or worse.  Then some companies tell them they have to return to the office.  And they smell the disconnect.  The genie is out of the bottle folks:  remote work is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes lot of things harder.  It now takes extra work - and sometimes extra money - to get the team together as humans.  Do a team meal.  Get to know each other outside of work.  All of that is critical to building a good team.  And it makes it all that much harder to have the &amp;ldquo;more difficult&amp;rdquo; conversations around coaching.  Not to mention that telling a manager that they are micro-managing is extremly hard to do over a zoom call.  But if it needs to happen, it needs to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;developing-junior-engineers&#34;&gt;Developing Junior Engineers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a whole new set of skills that managers need today: how to coach and teach new Engineers the basics.  Not just WHAT do do, but WHY we do it that way.  I&amp;rsquo;m astonished at the gaps of some junior Engineers I&amp;rsquo;ve known recently who could tell you all about data structures and algorithms and nothing about how to use git, how to build, how to deploy, why you would do it one way or another.  Computer Science teaches the Science, not the Engineering.  If they were Civil Engineers they would know the tensile strength of steel but not how to do a coffer dam to keep the water out to pour the foundation of the bridge towers.  Theory verses practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our educational system is focusing a lot on theory.  Juniors are supposed to get the practice in their early jobs.  That are now remote.  The chances to go out for food or drink at lunch or right after work and get a lesson simply is not there.  That creates a vacuum.  How will we pass on all this knowledge?  Managers need to figure that out.  And the LoL&amp;rsquo;s never dealth with this so they have no experience to share.  We&amp;rsquo;ll all have to sort this together.  But in the meantime even a well-oiled software org will have a gap in this area.  We have to find a way to mentor junior Engineers when they work remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bigger-trap&#34;&gt;The Bigger Trap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an LoL who didn&amp;rsquo;t learn the manager lessons along the way &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you have junior Engineers then you run some real risks.  Junior folks are likely to be intimidated by a high-level leader interacting with them regularly.  Even more senior folks can be intimidated.  And if you combine it with a mostly remote team the &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; parts can get lost and junior staff can feel like they are being criticized.  I know that I can come across differently in writing (email, code reviews, etc.) than I do in person.  I can seem harsh or overly critical, and I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to be that way.  This kind of thing can make folks &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; bad things.  And that can lead to unhappiness.  And unhappy Engineers are unproductive.  Worse, they may leave you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s leaders need to worry about the Leadership Pipeline &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the risks of remote workers.  The latter can magnify the former and keep a team (or company) from really reaching what they are capable of.  If you are a LoL you should be taking extra steps to spend extra time with your managers.  Drop into standups more.  Listen to design reviews more.  Take extra steps to encourage face to face meetings if you can.  Schedule in some fun time.  As I write this I know I don&amp;rsquo;t do this enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s part of why I blog:  to make me reflect, and to try to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Memorial Day is special to me as a former submariner.  Many have sacrificed for our freedoms, but the US Submarine Force more than many.  Memorial Day is when I honor that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years I&amp;rsquo;ve been attending the &amp;ldquo;Tolling of the Boats&amp;rdquo; ceremony - with my kids - at the USS Pampanito in San Francisco.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be there again this year too!  Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/e/lost-boat-ceremony-tickets-885214730087&#34;&gt;link to this year&amp;rsquo;s details.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/luca-ella-tolling.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Luca and Ella at the USS Pampanito (pre-COVID)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are both home and will be attending again with me this year.  It&amp;rsquo;s important to me that they understand where I came from, and that they honor our history as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not know this, but the US Submarine force had the highest casualty rate of any service in WWII:  nearly 20%.  One in five boats never came back. Yet they accounted for over 55% of all enemy ships destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that.  Two percent (2%) of all US forces accounted for 55% of all Axis shipping losses in the whole war.  But the cost was high:  20% of all US boats sank, often with all hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you wonder why submariners have a reputation for being a little crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ceremony&#34;&gt;Ceremony&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony simple:  the names of all lost boats are read, one at a time.  The date of the loss and number of crew lost is also stated.  The bell of the USS Pampanito is rung.  A flower is thrown into the water by the sub.  In much prior years the flowers would be thrown by family members of those lost.  Today everyone is welcome to line up and participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ceremony happens all over the US, anywhere with a history that was touched by US Submarines.  So many boats were built just north of SF at Mare Island Navy Shipyard (no longer a base) and of course, Hunters Point and Alameda were instrumental too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;52 US submarines were lost.  52 times the bell is rung, remembering the boats now on &amp;ldquo;Eternal Patrol.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am getting goosebumps as I write this.  Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because I lived underwater too, facing a fraction of the danger, but it&amp;rsquo;s all very real to me.  I&amp;rsquo;m proud of what I did and the role my boat played, but the WW2 Veterans are true heroes.  To know that if you left on your 5th mission that your number was probably up&amp;hellip; and do it anyway&amp;hellip;  the courage is astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written about the culture of excellence before.  It&amp;rsquo;s not just the Nuclear fleet - it&amp;rsquo;s submarines in general.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Operational-Excellence-Submarine-Organization-ebook/dp/B01LQZIVX0/ref=sr_1_1?&#34;&gt;Extreme Operational Excellence: Applying the US Nuclear Submarine Culture to Your Organization&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best books I have ever read.  I &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/ops-excellence/&#34;&gt;blogged about recently.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to know the crucible that forged those lessons, you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong by attending the Tolling of the Boats.  It&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to do something and take some time to reflect on the real meaning of Memorial Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not pop on down the Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf in San Francisco?  Don&amp;rsquo;t beleive the press saying how the City is full of crap and needles.  It&amp;rsquo;s still the most beautiful City in the world and the negative hype is mostly just jealousy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ll be going.  Wearing the same ship&amp;rsquo;s ballcap I wore in the 80&amp;rsquo;s and saluting my flag and shedding a few tears for bothers I never met.  But they ARE my brothers, and I may be here because of their sacrifices and certainly their teachings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fair winds and following seas to them all.  We have the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Whale Song Delayed - New Technology</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-new-tech/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;A short update on my whale song project: it&amp;rsquo;s shifting technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a nice exchange with the CTO of Sofar.  There are patents on the connectors.  They also do own the data that moves across their network.  They have a reason for that, and I respect that.  It just does not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also learned a ton.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think cellular or satellite data is needed for my project.  I will be in coastal/bay waters well within link range for several other technologies.  I also don&amp;rsquo;t think that transferring full whale song audio over those links is yet commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/whale-tail.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Humpback whale tail in the Bay of Banderas, near Puerto Vallarta Mexico.  January 2024.  Photo by Greg Herlein&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered that many scientists have literally thousands of hours of whale song recording.  We need to move forward with ML on that.  Scientist are making breakthroughs on decoding whale song, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/13/world/whale-communication-coda-alphabet-scn/index.html&#34;&gt;mapping an alphabet of sperm whale clicks.&lt;/a&gt;  The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;we need to record more whale songs&amp;rdquo; it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;we need to decode it, and then we need ways to replay it.&amp;rdquo;   This means we need to focus on an easy way to have transponders to not just receive but also to transmit.  And the sensor package in the water will need more power than what the SoFar can do.  So the Spotter looks less and less like a good fit for my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m returning the Sofar Spotter, as cool as it is.  Their CTO understands my position and has offered me some node boards/etc. to test with if I need them.  This lets someone else have this dev kit and do something cool, and I&amp;rsquo;ll stay connected to the company and team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My whale song efforts are very much a side project for me, but very much on my mind.  I&amp;rsquo;m still in awe of these majestic creatures of the deep and want to apply my technology skills to help understand them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.  Expect some radio technology discussion, some more Linux, some ML and perhaps even CUDA.  And some acoustic transponder stuff too, soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Dream Teams</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/dream-team/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Apr 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/dream-team/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A friend was telling me about &amp;ldquo;Dream Teams&amp;rdquo; at Netflix and I realized &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; is exactly what I have been trying to build/encourage around me.  That is what I want!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning&#34;&gt;Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am always studying something.  Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s technical, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s leadership, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s business.  Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s another language (Spanish) which I am absolutely terrible at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, technically, I am studying a lot to answer the question &amp;ldquo;How does one test complex video quality and distributed systems automatically and cost-effectively?&amp;rdquo;  Personally I am studying for my Ham Radio license (which I have said I would get since I was a Navy ET on a Nuclear Submarine in the 1980s).  Back then Nuclear Power ETs had to take the same core schools and advancement tests as the &amp;ldquo;radio ETs&amp;rdquo; so once upon a time I was actually quite &amp;ldquo;heavy&amp;rdquo; in all that.  It&amp;rsquo;s astonishing how much of it all I actually remember too.  But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; study leadership.  I&amp;rsquo;m always watching and thinking about how to lead better.  Who do I look up to and admire?  How do they do it?  I am blessed with some really good mentors who are in that category.  So when an old friend who I&amp;rsquo;d not spoken to in awhile mentioned the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jobs.netflix.com/culture&#34;&gt;Netflix culture&lt;/a&gt; and how they aspire to build &amp;ldquo;Dream Teams&amp;rdquo; I checked it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s not the NBA version of a dream team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/not-dream-team-nba.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Not This Dream Team!&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-dream-team&#34;&gt;What is a Dream Team?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to describe it is to quote them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dream team is one in which all of your colleagues are extraordinary at what they do
and highly effective working together. Our version of a great workplace is not great
perks, although we have many. It’s about investing in a dream team of talented people
who are excited to pursue ambitious shared goals. On our dream team we encourage
collaboration, share information and discourage politics. There’s lots of love and
there are demanding peers. It’s exhilarating and how we learn the most, do our best
work, improve the fastest and have the most fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://jobs.netflix.com/culture&#34;&gt;Netflix Culture&lt;/a&gt; resonates with everything in my being.  I may write more about it later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the term, but DREAM TEAMS are what I often talk about.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had that a few times and I constantly am trying to get it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I experienced it was on a Nuclear Submarine.  You can&amp;rsquo;t get more Dream Team.  The very real risk of everyone dying forces a new and crystal clear approach:  don&amp;rsquo;t just be the best you can be, be better.  And make everyone around you that good.  And then get better.  There&amp;rsquo;s no feeling like being on a team that is THAT GOOD.  I recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/ops-excellence/&#34;&gt;blogged about how that excellence is built&lt;/a&gt;.  It does not happen by accident.  The short version is: go read this book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Operational-Excellence-Submarine-Organization-ebook/dp/B01LQZIVX0/ref=sr_1_1?&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ops-excellence.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Operational Excellence book cover&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the civilian world I&amp;rsquo;ve chased that feeling at every job I&amp;rsquo;ve had.  What I did in the Navy was far more intense than anything I will do in business.  I can&amp;rsquo;t expect to have that same driving force and the whole environment is different.  But the principles are the same, and the FEELING is the same.  And the results are strikingly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to explain this to folks I am hiring.  But I use way too many words to describe it.  Often I say &amp;ldquo;I want to build a team that in 10 years still gets together for a meal or drink to catch up and share time.&amp;rdquo;  Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s one aspect.  That&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;lots of love&amp;rdquo; part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve pre-ordered an amazing-looking book by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertroncska/&#34;&gt;former US Navy Submarine Commander Dr. &amp;ldquo;Navy Bob&amp;rdquo; Roncska&lt;/a&gt;.  The book is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0D1SMCFKJ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_351_o00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;Beyond the Sea: Leading with Love from the Nuclear Navy to the White House and Healthcare&lt;/a&gt;.  These topics are resonating with me a lot I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I am seeking is also the &amp;ldquo;all colleagues are extraordinary at what they do&amp;rdquo; part.  I&amp;rsquo;ll go even further and say it&amp;rsquo;s all about the three things that Engineers want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;to build something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that actually helps people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that actually gets used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sports it&amp;rsquo;s all about winning.  In Engineering it&amp;rsquo;s more than &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; winning.  Or, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s that the definition of winning is larger.  It&amp;rsquo;s those three key accomplishments as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I find myself reflecting a lot.  My wife asked me recently &amp;ldquo;what do you really want?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be on a Dream Team accomplishing those three key things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about it from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-learning&#34;&gt;Back to Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I have been in an uncomfortable place, and I realized this week some of what is going on.  If you read my blog at all you know I admire and respect the accomplishments of Admiral Rickover (Father of the Nuclear Navy).  He said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Success teaches us nothing; only failure teaches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m getting some teaching lately!  Mostly around how I approach leadership under challenging conditions, and what I actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I am not going to beat myself up.  I love this graphic about the PROCESS of learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/non-linear-learning.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; href=&#34;https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Non-Linear-Learning-not-only-in-the-Classroom-Accordingly-the-Figure-3-Learning-Map-was_fig4_374509814&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Credit: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Non-Linear-Learning-not-only-in-the-Classroom-Accordingly-the-Figure-3-Learning-Map-was_fig4_374509814&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning is most certainly non-linear.  The most important thing can sometimes be the &amp;ldquo;Pause and Reflect&amp;rdquo; part.  Which is where I am at today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing I don&amp;rsquo;t like about that graphic is the &amp;ldquo;End&amp;rdquo; circle.  You never stop learning.  Well, maybe you do.  When you&amp;rsquo;re dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not dead yet!  So I will keep learning.  It&amp;rsquo;s actually one of my key personal core values:  never stop learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what I have learned this week is that I want to be on a Dream Team.  So what I need to do is focus on that and make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whale Song Update</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A short update on my whale song project:  it&amp;rsquo;s delayed.  Need to sort out some legal stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short answer:  the Bristlemouth &amp;ldquo;standard&amp;rdquo; has some patents and the licensing of those is not clear.  It&amp;rsquo;s not even documented.  It&amp;rsquo;s hanging out there like impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the license agreement to use the SOFAR communicaitons backend states that they own the data you move across it.  Also a sense of impending doom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have written SOFAR and asked for clarity.  They said the needed to loop in higher than just the support folks (makes sense).  It&amp;rsquo;s been a few weeks and no answer yet so I am assuming it will be a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I am not sure that cell or satellite is the right answer.  Looking over radio options I renewed my interest in Amateur (HAM) Radio.  Looks like I may be playing with radio technology before I do the whale song project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand by!  More to come.  Remember that it&amp;rsquo;s all about learning for me anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hiring is a Two-Way Street</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/two-way-street/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Apr 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/two-way-street/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about tech hiring and why it&amp;rsquo;s a crap-show for so many. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted my thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/staffing&#34;&gt;staffing software engineers&lt;/a&gt; but I have some musing on the way hiring is done today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I know a lot of people who have been laid off from their tech jobs.  The industry is going through another round of cutting costs to increase valuation (in my opinion).  Few of these companies are in distress, but it seems that occasionally cutting a bunch of costs makes stock prices increase.  It&amp;rsquo;s the game, I guess.  But it&amp;rsquo;s made me reflect on the state of hiring Engineering talent right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been hiring a lot of folks.  Some upskilling, some increases in staff, and also some replacement of people that have retired.  I like to recruit, and I think I&amp;rsquo;m pretty good at it.  I have a solid track record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; what do I do that I think makes me successful at this?  I think it&amp;rsquo;s because I take the approach that it&amp;rsquo;s a two-way street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/two-way.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;small&gt;Hiring is a two-way street&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-tech-hiring-is-broken&#34;&gt;Why Tech Hiring is Broken&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that a lot of companies are operating from a mindset of &amp;ldquo;we have the job, the candidates want the job, they will come to us.&amp;rdquo;  The whole &amp;ldquo;post a job listing and have folks apply&amp;rdquo; reflects that.  There is an implicit power dynamic shifted strongly to the employer.  And I think a lot of recruiting efforts reflect that mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extreme cases are like what &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meta.com/&#34;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; does:  you apply for a job with the company without even knowing what team you may go to.  Really?  You may end up on a team with a manager and others who you really don&amp;rsquo;t jive with. It&amp;rsquo;s a reflection of the idea that Engineers are somewhat fungible (or business wants them to be).  This is consistent with the entire Industrial Revolution.  And it underscores that the power dynamic is with the larger company.  But why?  They pay high comp packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do sometimes wonder if the large high-end tech company strategy is to hire a lot of who they think are good, even if the only reason is to deprive the competition of them.  Vacuum them up in droves and then every few years lay off - often just as indiscriminately - in the hope of keeping the better and losing the weaker. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just a seive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-are-changing&#34;&gt;Things Are Changing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly AI will be building a lot of the software that today&amp;rsquo;s rank and file large teams build. Folks coding to a spec, especially offshore teams, will see that most of that kind of coding will be done with AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t belabor with examples, but there&amp;rsquo;s a million times where you DON&amp;rsquo;T know how to solve the problem and/or you can&amp;rsquo;t just make a &amp;ldquo;prompt&amp;rdquo; that asks for the answer, or even worse there isn&amp;rsquo;t anything that could have trained an AI model with because you are doing something very new. The Software Engineers you want to be hiring are the ones that thrive doing those things.  And they are not average.  They are special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So.  You want to hire the special ones, but you think you will attract them by just posting jobs and then weeding out the avalanche of applications to find the gem in the pile?  How&amp;rsquo;s that working for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-approach&#34;&gt;My Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been hiring that kind of Engineer for decades.  I have always believed that a small team of experts will dance circles around a large team of average developers.  I talk about this in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/staffing&#34;&gt;thoughts on staffing software engineers.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that hiring is a two-way street.  I want candidates to know who they would be working with.  I encourage them to ask a lot of questions in the interview process.  I personally meet with the senior folks and spend a lot of time with them.  I try very hard to meet for coffee, lunch, dinner, or a pint and get to know them.  I want them to know my management style (discussed in my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/about/&#34;&gt;README&lt;/a&gt;).  I want to know them as a human &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; as an Engineer.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had 40 people give me strong recommendations on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gherlein/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, and I want candidates to read those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good Engineers want to work on a great team with great people.  They want to know who the leaders of those teams are.  They want to BELIEVE in the mission of that group and company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t get that by basically line fishing for Engineers with postings.  I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s worked &amp;ldquo;well enough&amp;rdquo; for most though.  Through trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe you need to seek out the Engineers you want.  This sometimes means working with recruiters.  These last few years I have had fabulous success working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.socode.co.uk/&#34;&gt;SoCode&lt;/a&gt; - who are now also in the US.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-mould-a05b19b/&#34;&gt;Richard Mould&lt;/a&gt; has built an excellent team that actually listen and adapt to my needs.  Our de-facto account lead &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-swift/&#34;&gt;Charles Swift&lt;/a&gt; and his colleagues go the extra mile to really understand our business, our goals, our team, and the style of organization I am striving to build.  We meet regularly, sometimes for pint (or two).  They live and breathe the philosophies I am describing here.  I highly recommend them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do my own searches too, and I try to attend conferences and trade shows and meet new people and talk to folks recommended to me.  I&amp;rsquo;m constantly recruiting, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t have any openings.  And I tend to have Engineers follow me to wherever I move on to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a high touch, high effort game, but I like my results.  Every team I have built I would work with again in a heartbeat.  They all make great product, they work together well, and often they stay close long after they are all at the same company.  Those are the teams that companies really need.  That is what companies should be hiring for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, it&amp;rsquo;s understanding that it&amp;rsquo;s a two-way street.  The Engineers you want and need really need to want to work for you.  They need to know you, and what you want to do, what your values are.  The power dynamic is more balanced.  Things need to work for both parties.  Yes, it is often hard to compete with huge comp packages. But many of those really good Engineers care just as much about the environment they will work in.  And who they work for.  And that&amp;rsquo;s incredibly hard to evaluate at the huge companies.  And that&amp;rsquo;s assuming they don&amp;rsquo;t re-org and move around all the chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring takes many hours.  And real effort.  And honesty.  And transparency.  You have to be a real person, talking to Engineers like they are real people and not just a replacable gear in a system of gears making up a giant clock.  You have to be able to explain your business and especially how the work the candidate would do helps that mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to communicate.  Not just harvest applications and sift through a pile and hope you get a good set to then interview.  It takes way more work than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good Engineers are not fungible.  And they are hard to replace.  Companies should invest appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in a future post:  how to translate this to large companies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Bristlemouth Dev Kit: SLOW - and Thinking</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/bristlemouth-slow/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Work on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter#s-subsurface&#34;&gt;SOFAR Spotter&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.notion.site/Developer-Kit-User-Guides-e9ca1b3c5a1c41c890d0105f2eb7c4b8&#34;&gt;Development Kit&lt;/a&gt; is slower than I hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;status&#34;&gt;Status&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been especially busy and stressful and I have not had anywhere near enough time to work on my Whale Project.  This is basically where it sits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/bristlemouth.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;SOFAR Spotter and Dev Kit on my desk&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still where it was at the beginning of the month.  Two trips the UK in Q1 took a huge bite out of my time.  April will be slow too, since I have long-planned visits from far-away family.  There won&amp;rsquo;t be much time in April for personal projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts-on-the-terms-of-use&#34;&gt;Thoughts on the Terms of Use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got it set up and configured and set up the build environment before I paused.  And that gives me some time to really think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear that what I am about to say is not a criticism of SOFAR at all.  They kindly gave me this hardware and I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.  This dev kit is AMAZING and will defiitely move the state of the art forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many people and organizations, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofarocean.com/legal/terms-of-use&#34;&gt;SOFAR Terms of Use&lt;/a&gt; may have a mine hidden in it.  Section 5.4 says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.4 Spotter Data. You hereby grant Sofar an unrestricted, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, fully-paid,
royalty-free right and license (with right to sublicense) to obtain Spotter Data, and to host, store, transfer, display,
perform, reproduce, modify, adapt, and distribute Spotter Data, in whole or in part, in any format and through any channels
now known or hereafter developed, and to exploit the Spotter Data in any manner and for any purpose, including to improve the
Service and to create other products or services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that if you use their cloud service to collect data from a Spotter then they can use your data however they want - including letting others use the data however they want.  They could even allow someone to use the data to write a scientific paper or build a product based around it.  If you use the Spotter, your data is NOT &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many folks that&amp;rsquo;s not a problem.  And it&amp;rsquo;s their right to put those terms in there.  But it does make one wonder if those terms are acceptable.  It does make me think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wonder if satellite data is really a necessary option for my project.  Everywhere I see whales I&amp;rsquo;m in a spot where my phone works. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s practical yet to really transfer large audio files even over cell.  It may be better to use a slower, long range radio and trickle the data in, or even use WiFi and just go collect data by boat.  That doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself to the &amp;ldquo;phone system for whales&amp;rdquo; idea but to get started lower data costs are key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think more processing power on the device may be needed.  I&amp;rsquo;m inspired by the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/AI-at-Edge-Daniel-Situnayake-ebook/dp/B0BS2FKXW4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&#34;&gt;AI at the Edge&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m pondering applications of edge AI in my day job and it&amp;rsquo;s made me think more about how I would really build a whalesong system.  More on that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/AI-at-Edge-Daniel-Situnayake-ebook/dp/B0BS2FKXW4/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ai-at-the-edge.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts-on-the-bristlemouth-standard&#34;&gt;Thoughts on the Bristlemouth Standard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristlemouth is a proposed standard that solves several problems for harsh environment data systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;combined power distribution and networking across a strong cable system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the cable system is waterproof with standard connectors that are field installable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides a standard communication and node management/data management protocol&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SOFAR kit also provides:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a build platform that enables development of platforms that require low-power, connected systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;all the data collection infrastructure provided - developers can focus ONLY on the sensor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is amazing, and will be huge for most of the marine science ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts-on-the-mcu-choice&#34;&gt;Thoughts on the MCU Choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the SOFAR Dev Kit design is predicated on the low-power, autonomous aspects.  This drove the design for a low-power embedded board - the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.notion.site/Technical-Documentation-053f9b96f3f143d1a7e12ebb43814ae9#3a7293357f2448a3a208f90a5c6ef537&#34;&gt;Mote&lt;/a&gt; that connects to the Dev Board over a mezzanine connector usually used in mobile phones.  You can see the schematic &lt;a href=&#34;https://file.notion.so/f/f/ecca0679-b04e-423c-a8e8-21cb7e08d702/48e22e81-bf28-4045-8826-5b19ddab954e/Bristlemouth_Dev_Board_Schematics.pdf?id=eb4616ff-c669-4905-b750-b3a7f67ec90b&amp;table=block&amp;spaceId=ecca0679-b04e-423c-a8e8-21cb7e08d702&amp;expirationTimestamp=1711994400000&amp;signature=W4-DkUUjlsU3O90keiPXkfmLC4HKu-OdKtHiU9J69iY&amp;downloadName=Bristlemouth_Dev_Board_Schematics.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mote itself uses an STM32 board.  The schematic is &lt;a href=&#34;https://file.notion.so/f/f/ecca0679-b04e-423c-a8e8-21cb7e08d702/09f69be8-a352-4e83-94e5-ec3750a1219e/Bristlemouth_Mote_Schematics.pdf?id=b4ef3307-e71b-4158-ac98-ef80f738983c&amp;table=block&amp;spaceId=ecca0679-b04e-423c-a8e8-21cb7e08d702&amp;expirationTimestamp=1711994400000&amp;signature=XcjMfSly9VGGfJ8hc_9BC5k2bWpxn8daHVmvGz5xbkA&amp;downloadName=Bristlemouth_Mote_Schematics.pdf&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can see a lot of applications where I would not necessarily want to use such a low powered MCU.  Choosing that puts one into the realm of using an RTOS.  The SOFAR kit does a GREAT job of hiding that complexity away.  It might actually work.  But in my experience at some point the complexity comes back to bite you and you need to really understand it in depth.  And for a lot of developers that will be an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;things-i-am-considering&#34;&gt;Things I am Considering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you look at the schematic the number of connections needed to implement a node are not all that many:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/mezzanine.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s basically I2C, some SPI, and some GPIO.  This is not that different than what I was trying to do with my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/boards/&#34;&gt;RBOT Project&lt;/a&gt;.  And I hit walls there too, trying to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freertos.org/index.html&#34;&gt;FreeRTOS&lt;/a&gt; when developing on Linux would have been much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a Linux solution for Bristlemouth would enable development much faster too.  But this means not leveraging all the amazing work that SOFAR has already done.  That&amp;rsquo;s a lot of platform to just set aside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the key reason I do these things is to learn.  And developing a Linux-based implementation of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.notion.site/Bristlemouth-Protocol-Documentation-83b18bf2f00a4af99fb534348d0366c4&#34;&gt;Bristlemouth protocol &lt;/a&gt; is certainly a learning opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-power consumption Linux has been with us for a long time in the form of Android phones.  But not all marine (or harsh environment) applications have such a low-power requirement.  The Spotter has a relatively small number of square inches of solar panels.  More panels and a larger battery could support a Linux solution (though I have not done the power budget analysis).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key thing about this is that it would enable MUCH EASIER development and testing.  Keeping everything in Linux-space would enable easy mocking, development and especially testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s something I am thinking about.  But probably not doing anything in April.  I have family visiting!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review:  Extreme Operational Excellence</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ops-excellence/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Mar 2024 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I finally have a book that describes my management philosophy.  Two retired US Navy Submariners Officers describe how the core principles of the Submarine Service are the perfect model for excellence in the business world too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Operational-Excellence-Submarine-Organization-ebook/dp/B01LQZIVX0/ref=sr_1_1?&#34;&gt;Extreme Operational Excellence: Applying the US Nuclear Submarine Culture to Your Organization&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best books I have ever read.  If you want to understand me and the way I work, read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand how to REALLY accomplish organizational excellence, read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand why US Submariners are the way they are, read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just read this book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Operational-Excellence-Submarine-Organization-ebook/dp/B01LQZIVX0/ref=sr_1_1?&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ops-excellence.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Operational Excellence book cover&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-thoughts&#34;&gt;Some Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Operational excellence is a CULTURE (emphasis mine) fully devoted to professional knowledge, brutally honest self-assessment, continuous improvement, and intellectual integrity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  Yes.  If you know me at all and pause and remember the blog post I wrote in 2020 &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/sre-123/&#34;&gt;SRE 123&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; you will see some similarities.  The whole SRE ideal is all about blameless culture, constant measurement and learning, and asking why.  It&amp;rsquo;s really not surprising that I took to SRE principles so easily.  It&amp;rsquo;s how I was trained!  My early professional years were in the US Navy as a nuclear reactor Electronics Technician (ET), Reactor Operator (RO) and then Engineering Watch Supervisor (EWS).  I qualified in submarines and earned the right to wear the submarine special warfare insignia we lovingly call &amp;ldquo;dolphins.&amp;rdquo;  My sub was among the best of the best, earning multiple &amp;ldquo;Battle E&amp;rdquo; awards for excellence as well as the very rare Navy Unit Citation and extremely rare Presidential Unit Citation.  I had the absolute best mentorship in the best environment to really learn how to have operational excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really should &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Operational-Excellence-Submarine-Organization-ebook/dp/B01LQZIVX0/ref=sr_1_1?&#34;&gt;read the book&lt;/a&gt;  but I teased this nugget out that describes the essence of what must exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people put truth above ego and perception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have processes that enforce unwavering standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that &amp;ldquo;excellence&amp;rdquo; CAN be somewhat situational dependent.  If you are selling ice cream from a popsicle stand you don&amp;rsquo;t need the same rigor as you do on a nuclear sub.  The principles hold, but the processes can be much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One incredibly interesting part that resonated with me was the observation that a new leaders first job is to evaluate how the pendulum of operational excellence is swinging.  Is it getting better or worse?  More importantly, does management agree with that assessment?  The authors point out that when that happens then that friction has to be resolved before anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I am pondering as I look back over my career in high tech is that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that lesson yet.  Some of the positions I have had did not have a consistent and agreed upon view of what &amp;ldquo;excellence&amp;rdquo; looks like.  There can also be large mis-matches in how much &amp;ldquo;quality&amp;rdquo; different leaders think different functions need.  Looking back, I can see that some leaders I had friction with thought we could let some functions/products/areas slide with minimal attention/budget/expectations - perhaps becauase they thought those things were not vital to the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided how I feel about that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questioning-attitude&#34;&gt;Questioning Attitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has some excellent case studies out of regular non-high-tech business.  One in particular struck me about a company that changed a water treatment chemical and despite signs that it was failing at every stage of the process no one thought to ask &amp;ldquo;is this unusual thing I&amp;rsquo;m seeing because we made a change?  Why is it different?&amp;rdquo;  This kind of thinking is critical in any business or operation.  In that example case it cost the company millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quote in the book really struck me:  &amp;ldquo;A questioning attitude is a skill.&amp;rdquo;  Damn.  I&amp;rsquo;d not really thought of it that way.  I&amp;rsquo;m now super motivated to add some training in my current company about HOW to question, HOW to develop a perspective where one is always asking &amp;ldquo;why is that?&amp;rdquo;  The book has some great observations about some of the cultural things that have to exist to allow folks to have a questioning attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-now-we-are-back-at-that-word--culture&#34;&gt;And now we are back at that word:  Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture has been described as &amp;ldquo;the worst behaviors that leadership are willing to tolerate.&amp;rdquo;  Having been at some companies where that was the case I can mostly agree.  But culture is also, to a large degree, the mind set of the group and what they are willing to tolerate - and what they aspire to.  How they want to work and think and collaborate.  I do think you can grow a better culture from the middle of a company.  It is so much harder to do if the top leaders oppose you, of course.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t think you need cultural change to be initiatied from the C-Suite.  We can all lead from whatever role we have. But for lasting company-wide change it needs C-Suite to lead the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this book.  I can promise you will learn things and you will think about excellence in a very different way.  I am indebted to the authors for putting in writing all the core values that were instilled in me - that I had not realized I was using still today.  Now I can say &amp;ldquo;you want to know my leadership style?  It&amp;rsquo;s patterned on this book.&amp;rdquo;  Becase that&amp;rsquo;s the world I was trained in.  Once upon a time, in a galaxy far far away.  It&amp;rsquo;s been long enough that I feel that way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review:  Operational Excellence</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/opsexcellence/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I finally have a book that describes my management philosophy.  Two retired US Navy Submariners Officers describe how the core principles of the Submarine Service are the perfect model for excellence in the business world too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Operational-Excellence-Submarine-Organization-ebook/dp/B01LQZIVX0/ref=sr_1_1?&#34;&gt;Extreme Operational Excellence: Applying the US Nuclear Submarine Culture to Your Organization&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best books I have ever read.  If you want to understand me and the way I work, read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand how to REALLY accomplish organizational excellence, read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to understand why US Submariners are the way they are, read this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just read this book!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ops-excellence.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Operational Excellence book cover&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-thoughts&#34;&gt;Some Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Operational excellence is a CULTURE (emphasis mine) fully devoted to professional knowledge, brutally honest self-assessment, continuous improvement, and itellectual integrity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow.  Yes.  If you know me at all and pause and remember the blog post I wrote in 2020 &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/sre-123/&#34;&gt;SRE 123&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; you will see some similarities.  The whole SRE ideal is all about blameless culture, constant measurement and learning, and asking why.  It&amp;rsquo;s really not surprising that I took to SRE principles so easily.  It&amp;rsquo;s how I was trained!  My early professional years were in the US Navy as a nuclear reactor Electronics Technician (ET), Reactor Operator (RO) and then Engineering Watch Supervisor (EWS).  I qualified in submarines and earned the right to wear the submarine special warfare insignia we lovingly call &amp;ldquo;dolphins.&amp;rdquo;  My sub was among the best of the best, earning multiple &amp;ldquo;Battle E&amp;rdquo; awards for excellence as well as the very rare Navy Unit Citation and extremely rare Presidential Unit Citation.  I had the absolute best mentorship in the best environment to really learn how to have operational excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really should read the book but I teased this nugget out that describes the essence of what must exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people put truth above ego and perception&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you have processes that enforce unwavering standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;integrity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that &amp;ldquo;excellence&amp;rdquo; CAN be somewhat situational dependent.  If you are selling ice cream from a pop-sickle stand you don&amp;rsquo;t need the same rigo as you do on a nuclear sub.  The principles hold, but the processes can be much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One incredibly interesting part that resonated with me was the observation that a new leaders first job is to evaluate how the pendulum of operational excellence is swinging.  Is it getting better or worse?  More importantly, does management agree with that assessment?  The authors point out that when that happens then that friction has to be resolved before anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I am pondering as I look back over my career in high tech is that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that lesson yet.  Some of the positions I have had did not have a consistent and agreed upon view of what &amp;ldquo;excellence&amp;rdquo; looks like.  There can also be large mis-matches in how much &amp;ldquo;quality&amp;rdquo; different leaders think different functions need.  Looking back, I can see that some leaders I had friction with thought we could let some functions/products/areas slide with minimal attention/budget/expectations - perhaps becauase they thought those things were not vital to the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided how I feel about that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;questioning-attitude&#34;&gt;Questioning Attitude&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has some excellent case studies out of regular non-high-tech business.  One in particular struck me about a company that changed a water treatment chemical and despite signs that it was failing at every stage of the process no one thought to ask &amp;ldquo;is this unusual thing I&amp;rsquo;m seeing because we made a change?  Why is it different?&amp;rdquo;  This kind of thinking is critical in any business or operation.  In that example case it cost the company millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One quite really struck me:  &amp;ldquo;A questioning attitude is a skill.&amp;rdquo;  Damn.  I&amp;rsquo;d not really thought of it that way.  I&amp;rsquo;m now super motivated to add some training in my current company about HOW to question, HOW to develop a perspective where one is always asking &amp;ldquo;why is that?&amp;rdquo;  The book has some great observations about some of the cultural things that have to exist to allow folks to have a questioning attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-now-we-are-back-at-that-word--culture&#34;&gt;And now we are back at that word:  Culture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture has been described as &amp;ldquo;the worst behaviors that leadership are willing to tolerate.&amp;rdquo;  Having been at some companies where that was the case I can mostly agree.  But culture is also, to a large degree, the mind set of the group and what they are willing to tolerate.  How they want to work and think and collaborate.  I do think you can grow a better culture from the middle of a company.  It is so much harder to do if the top leaders oppose you, of course.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t think you need cultural change to be initiatied from the C-Suite.  We can all lead from whatever role we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this book.  I can promise you will learn things and you will think about excellence in a very different way.  I am indebted to the authors for putting in writing all the core values that were instilled in me - that I had not realized I was using still today.  Now I can say &amp;ldquo;you want to know my leadership style?  It&amp;rsquo;s patterned on this book.  Becase that&amp;rsquo;s the world I was trained in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I have possession and unboxed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter#s-subsurface&#34;&gt;SOFAR Spotter&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.notion.site/Developer-Kit-User-Guides-e9ca1b3c5a1c41c890d0105f2eb7c4b8&#34;&gt;Development Kit&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes!  I have it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/bristlemouth.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;SOFAR Spotter and Dev Kit on my desk&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hooked up and I can talk to it.  The Dev Kit is being powered over the long tether line directly from the Spotter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I can get to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bristlemouth Dev Kit May Not Happen</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/bristlemouth-questionable/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter#s-subsurface&#34;&gt;SOFAR Spotter&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.notion.site/Developer-Kit-User-Guides-e9ca1b3c5a1c41c890d0105f2eb7c4b8&#34;&gt;Development Kit&lt;/a&gt; may not be able to get to me.  There&amp;rsquo;s some legal paperwork that I don&amp;rsquo;t have - that may be quite expensive to get.  Import/Export laws are a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOFAR was nice enough to hook me up with their agent and pay the duties.  But I need to have a business license in Mexico to import.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have one, and getting one likely requires me to have other conditions met and would make me liable for taxes here.  For a personal hobby project this may not be viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few ideas still, but I was likely premature blogging about this before I actually had the hardware in hand.  I should have learned from my time on the Research Vessel Atlantis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/alvin5.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;R/V Atlantis and Alvin, circa 1997 when I was onboard&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We constantly had import problems and the ship&amp;rsquo;s agent was routinely dealing with getting things through customs.  I worried about that but SOFAR said they could handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful, but let&amp;rsquo;s wait and see!  There&amp;rsquo;s not much I can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Whale Song - Some Background</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-song/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/whale-song/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Recent press about an actual conversation with a whale was preceeded by ground-breaking work by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-e-h-fournet-she-her-51033b85/&#34;&gt;Dr. Michelle Fournet&lt;/a&gt; and profiled in the fantastic documentary &lt;a href=&#34;https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/fathom/umc.cmc.5dba56sgwst50iuh5h9uqpdsq&#34;&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt; on AppleTV.  This is a MUST WATCH if you love the ocean - or humanity!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-can-talk-to-whales&#34;&gt;We Can Talk to Whales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seti.org/press-release/whale-seti-groundbreaking-encounter-humpback-whales-reveals-potential-non-human-intelligence&#34;&gt;actual conversation with a whale&lt;/a&gt;.  The research paper cited in that article is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://peerj.com/articles/16349/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; where they scientifically document &amp;ldquo;a 20-min acoustic exchange between the broadcast of a recorded contact call, known as a ‘whup/throp’, with call responses&amp;rdquo; by a specific lone Humpback whale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/whales-pv.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;Humpback whales in the Bay of Banderas, near Puerto Vallarta Mexico.  December 2023.  Photo by Greg Herlein&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-foundational-science&#34;&gt;The Foundational Science&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;whup&amp;rdquo; call that is a &amp;ldquo;Hi, my name is &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; seems to have been identified and initially confirmed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelle-e-h-fournet-she-her-51033b85/&#34;&gt;Dr. Michelle Fournet&lt;/a&gt; and profiled in the fantastic documentary &lt;a href=&#34;https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/fathom/umc.cmc.5dba56sgwst50iuh5h9uqpdsq&#34;&gt;Fathom&lt;/a&gt; on AppleTV.  It was seeing that show a year ago that first set me on my idea of wanting to build a hydraphone to get more of these recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fathom also profiles the challenges faced by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/biology/people/ecg5/&#34;&gt;Dr. Ellen Garland&lt;/a&gt; who studies how whale song propogates across different groups of whales, and how that communication is actually a community that pre-dates humanity by millions of years.  It&amp;rsquo;s truly astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have not seen this show, you are in for a treat.  The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and the storyline shows just how difficult the collection can be.  The scientists go out on a boat every day and hope they find whales and hope they are singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope is not a strategy.  But it&amp;rsquo;s the best they have got.  The collection efforts are fraught with challenges and the equipment is not readily available and standard.  The equipment to do the recording has to be rugged for field use and yet simple enough to build and maintain.  One estimate I heard for the cost to duplicate Dr. Fournet&amp;rsquo;s gear is $20K USD.  In Fathom she lost 25% of her field time for recordings because her small boat engine broke.  What&amp;rsquo;s amazing in Fathom is how the gear used by Dr. Garland is vastly different than what is used by Dr. Fournet.  I am guessing that every science team is building their own solution, re-inventing the wheel and slowing down their overall work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-hopes&#34;&gt;My Hopes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dream of a day when research sicentists can deploy a dozen or more hydrophones to an area with active whales and collect the data remotely.  Even better:  if connected to the internet (by a variety of radio technologies) and with the ability to transmit sound - as shown in the movie Fathom and described in the research paper above - we can remotely communicate with whales.  This would literally be a &amp;ldquo;telephone system to the whales.&amp;rdquo;  The hydrophones could even be mobile someday so they can follow the whales around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means we need to drive cost out of the tooling, and we need to make it standardized.  Think of what the Raspberry Pi did for single-board-computing technology.  THAT is actually what my goal is:  to contribute in some small way to moving the technology in the direction where real scientists have an easier time because they have tools at hand to do their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like I said above:  hope is not a strategy.  My personal plan is to do R&amp;amp;D work to standardize and simplify technology for marine acoustics.  I &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/bristlemouth-pioneer/&#34;&gt;blogged about this earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SOFAR Spotter is not cheap.  The one they sent me - with the development kit - costs $13K USD.  I could not have spent that for development which is why I am so excited that they granted me one as part of their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bristlemouth.org/pioneer&#34;&gt;Pioneer Program&lt;/a&gt;.  I strongly believe that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bristlemouth.org/&#34;&gt;Bristlemouth&lt;/a&gt; technology standard will drive costs down through standardization.  But even $13K - before adding a hydrophone - is way too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to a company that makes what appears to be an excellent, high-performance &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; hydraphone.  The list price is $10K.  Even if you integrate that with the Spotter you are taking $30K per unit.  I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine a science lab affording tens of those.  The costs are just too high still, for the science that deserves to be done.  We can integrate a much cheaper analog device and do the &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; work ourselves.  At least, that&amp;rsquo;s the part I want to do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t think a full Spotter is needed for this application.  We can simplify it.  But it&amp;rsquo;s a good platform as a start to really explore the Bristlemouth technology.  And that&amp;rsquo;s exactly what I am going to do next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you will follow along!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bristlemouth Dev Kit Delayed - Customs Woes</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/bristlemouth-delayed/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been accepted into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bristlemouth.org/pioneer&#34;&gt;Bristlemouth Pioneer Program&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been granted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter#s-subsurface&#34;&gt;SOFAR Spotter&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.notion.site/Developer-Kit-User-Guides-e9ca1b3c5a1c41c890d0105f2eb7c4b8&#34;&gt;Development Kit&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately it was detained in customs due to it&amp;rsquo;s high invoiced value.  I required a &amp;ldquo;customs agent&amp;rdquo; to clear it - which I did not have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like it will have to be returned to SOFAR.  They are aware of the problem and are engaged to help.  But the net effect is that I won&amp;rsquo;t get the kit for awhile - probably another few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patience was never my strong suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-other-news&#34;&gt;In Other News&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I met a guy here that is hooked up with scientists actually doing research around communicationg with whales.  So progress on one front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, [Hackaday}() published a new article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackaday.com/2023/12/28/keeping-watch-over-the-oceans-with-data-buoys/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Keeping Watch Over The Oceans with Data Buoys&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that is quite pertinent to what I&amp;rsquo;m playing with.  Thanks Scott for the link!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been accepted into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bristlemouth.org/pioneer&#34;&gt;Bristlemouth Pioneer Program&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been granted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter#s-subsurface&#34;&gt;SOFAR Spotter&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.notion.site/Developer-Kit-User-Guides-e9ca1b3c5a1c41c890d0105f2eb7c4b8&#34;&gt;Development Kit&lt;/a&gt;.  I want to build a system capable of autonomously recording whale song (and other ocean data).  &lt;a href=&#34;https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/sep22/mysteries-of-humpback-whale-song.html&#34;&gt;Humpback Whale songs&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly interesting - and scientists have JUST been able to actually talk to whales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really getting all &amp;ldquo;science fictiony&amp;rdquo; - can we build an ocean phone system to talk to whales?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this is a personal project. My employer has nothing to do with it.  This is all me, in my sparse spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bristlemouth---what-is-it&#34;&gt;Bristlemouth - What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bristlemouth.org/&#34;&gt;Bristlemouth&lt;/a&gt; is an &amp;ldquo;open standard delivering plug-and-play hardware interfaces for marine applications.&amp;rdquo;  But it&amp;rsquo;s really more than that.  That&amp;rsquo;s the focus.  But the technology solves a set of problems that include the ocean - and other harsh environments (think jungles, mountains, lakes, rivers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellular/Satellite communications for data collection.  Check. Power via solar charging and robust distribution to wired components?  Check.  Data networking over the same wires as power?  Check.  Waterproof.  Rated for deep ocean pressure.  Standardized.  Check.  Software infrastructure for automatic topology detection and message passing framework.  Check.  All of this right out of the box.  As a developer all you have to do is integrate your sensors into the platform.  The time and effort to build a marine sensor just dropped by 1000x.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have no idea how powerful this is.  Science is slowed by everyone having to re-invent wheels.  If Bristlemouth is succcesful we will see an explosion of new sensing devices deployed into the world.  The barriers to entry are reduced:  cost and time.  And funding should be made easier too.  Investment risks - even from grants - goes down if most of the platform is standard and field-proven. All you need is the new parts where the developers have the most subject matter expertise and you can be live in the field in a fraction of the time and expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have read my blog over the years you know that I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to build around these themes for hobby robotics.  My &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/rbot-value-prop/&#34;&gt;RBOT&lt;/a&gt; efforts were how to have low-cost way to hang sensors and actuators/motors off a hobby robotics board using cheap wiring and (hopefully) clever switching of I2C busses.  I dropped that project because it was too much work just for me.  It needed a COMMUNITY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristlemouth takes those themes to the big leagues using waterproof connectors and two-wire &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arrow.com/en/research-and-events/articles/the-new-10base-t1l-standard&#34;&gt;10BASE-T1L&lt;/a&gt; networking.  Coupled with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sofarocean.com/products/spotter&#34;&gt;Spotter&lt;/a&gt; from SOFAR that provides infrastructure for cellular and/or satellite communications and you have a PLATFORM.  Through the creation of their Pioneer Program they have created a COMMUNITY that centers around their own &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.discourse.group/&#34;&gt;discord group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/spotter-dev-kit.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By actually seeding developer kits out into the world they are brilliantly creating the ecosystem they need to drive adoption and build that community.  I&amp;rsquo;m honored that they thought my humble ideas worthy of sending me a kit that costs $12K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-project-and-goals&#34;&gt;My Project and Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me, then you know that my first objective is always learning.  I learn by doing, and I like to push at the edges of things to move knowledge and conversation along.  But my specific project idea is to learn more about the Humpback whales.  I am lucky to have a second home near the &lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.app.goo.gl/rVZUPXi2qjh9PFD8A&#34;&gt;Bahia de Banderas/Bay of Banderas&lt;/a&gt; in Mexico.  Every winter &lt;a href=&#34;https://ecobac.org/en/every-winter-500-humpback-whales-visit-banderas-bay/&#34;&gt;500-700 whales visit the bay&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve taken many boat trips to watch them - and sometimes listen to them.  You can sometimes hear the song right through the hull of the boat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to build an autonomous, free-floating system of bouys that dangle a hydrophone into the water.  I believe that collecting more whalesong can only help future efforts.  I imagine a network of 10+ sensors around the Bay, all recording audio.  In many cases, multiple sensors will &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; the same song.  this should be able to help locate the whales in at least 2d space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the science we can do is astounding.  Read below for some of what&amp;rsquo;s being done today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I can really blow your mind:  building this kind of network could be the start of an actual &amp;ldquo;whale phone system&amp;rdquo; to talk to whales all over the world.  How?  Read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;we-can-talk-to-whales&#34;&gt;We Can Talk to Whales&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seti.org/press-release/whale-seti-groundbreaking-encounter-humpback-whales-reveals-potential-non-human-intelligence&#34;&gt;actual conversation with a whale&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.google/technology/ai/pattern-radio-whale-songs/&#34;&gt;Google has tooling to explore recorded whale song&lt;/a&gt;.  Google worked with NOAA&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/&#34;&gt;National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)&lt;/a&gt;.  They are using recordings and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/using-ai-listen-and-learn-about-humpback-whales&#34;&gt;deep learning&lt;/a&gt; to make data sets available for study.  Dr. Carrie Wall of the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences leads the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/pad/&#34;&gt;Passive Acoustic Data Archive&lt;/a&gt; efforts for NCEI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my new sensors can supply more data for these kinds of incredible projects then I will have made a positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And fast forward with only a tiny bit of &amp;ldquo;science fiction what if&amp;rdquo; thinking:  if you have a network of bouys with hydrophones floating around where whales hang out, AND if you have decoded their songs enough that you can actually communicate, THEN you could have a network where a whale can say &amp;ldquo;hi&amp;rdquo; and a human somewhere can answer back.  It&amp;rsquo;s a phone system to the whales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hubris to think that little-old-me could actually build something like this out.  But I can dabble at it, and learn, and maybe move things along for serious scientists.  And who knows?  No one thought Linus Torvalds would change the world when he was just a Comp-Sci student.  Individuals CAN change the world.  I doubt that my efforts will be anywhere near world changing, but SOMEONE has to try things and then someone else carries on and eventually, progress.  And if all I get from it is learning and maybe help make a needed marine standard get adoption then I&amp;rsquo;m good with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-me&#34;&gt;Why Me?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in 2nd grade I loved watching &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Cousteau&#34;&gt;Jacques Cousteau&lt;/a&gt; on TV.  Only it was on at the same time as Monday Night Football.  This was an era where families did not have more than one TV.  My Dad found a used black and white TV for me to have in my room so he could watch the game and I could watch Jacques and dream.  In later years I went into the US Navy and served in Submarines.  And then got to work with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whoi.edu/&#34;&gt;Woods Hole (WHOI)&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/explore/ships/ships-atlantis/&#34;&gt;Research Vessel Atlantis&lt;/a&gt; with the amazing deep diving submersible &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whoi.edu/what-we-do/explore/underwater-vehicles/hov-alvin/&#34;&gt;Alvin&lt;/a&gt;.   I left that world and got married and settled in San Francisco, raised a family and have had an amazing and blessed technology career.  And now that my youngest is away in University I have some time and ability to get back to where my deep interests lie:  the ocean and the technology to explore it.  Just channeling a bit of Jacques and my 7-year-old self passion - tempered with 30+ years of experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Development Kit is in Mexico waiting to clear customs and then will be delivered to my home.  Over the next few months I&amp;rsquo;ll be first learning this system, and then integrating a hydrophone.  I&amp;rsquo;ll do early wet testing in my swimming pool.  I have a local whale watching captain who we use routinely who has agreed to take me out and wet test test it in the bay.  I&amp;rsquo;ve established contact with &lt;a href=&#34;https://ecobac.org/en/home-3/&#34;&gt;ECOBAC&lt;/a&gt;, a local whale conservation group.  &amp;ldquo;Ecología y Conservación de Ballenas, Ecology and Conservation of Whales (ECOBAC), is a Mexican non-profit organization, devoted mainly to research, protection and conservation of Mexico’s natural resources, specially the Humpback Whale in Banderas Bay.&amp;rdquo;  Through them I&amp;rsquo;ll make sure I don&amp;rsquo;t run afoul of the Mexican authorities.  I&amp;rsquo;m reaching out to scientists and interested techologists to collaborate, and of course will be actively blogging here and posting on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bristlemouth.discourse.group/&#34;&gt;Bristlemouth discord channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to the Mac</title>

        &lt;p&gt;I undid it.  I&amp;rsquo;m still using my desktop (mostly remotely) and I do love my Lenovo X1 Carbon.  But my primary machine is back to the Mac Book Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I travel a lot.  I&amp;rsquo;m back and forth to Mexico and in the UK at least four times a year.  I grew less and less comfortable with the durability of the X1 Carbon.  I also found that using Office365 apps in a browser WORKS but it&amp;rsquo;s not especially optimal yet.  There were a lot of things that were just hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing is that I wanted a bullet-proof solid machine and the Mac is that.  So it&amp;rsquo;s back to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also ditched Ubuntu yet again, for all the same reasons as before.  I installed Debian (again) and it just works.  It&amp;rsquo;s predictable, it does not do weird shit with every update, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to de-install all the crap snap stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s just back to the past, settling into the tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing new here.  These are not the droids you&amp;rsquo;re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facebook again?  Maybe?  But they still suck</title>

        &lt;p&gt;I left Facebook to get away from all the hate.  But there&amp;rsquo;s community information there I find valuable and so I signed up again (after years away).  And my account is suspended!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow their community standards EVEN BEFORE I LOGGED IN!  I can tell you that all I ever did was leave Facebook and delete my account there.  I certainly never &amp;ldquo;violated thier community standards&amp;rdquo; (as if they really have them with the hate they promote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a farce.  I &amp;ldquo;appealed&amp;rdquo; and we&amp;rsquo;ll see what happens.  If they don&amp;rsquo;t let me back in then I&amp;rsquo;ll continue to just get my information elsewhere.  I really don&amp;rsquo;t give a shit about them - it&amp;rsquo;s just some local groups I want to follow.  I can create a shadow account for that I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and yes, I am trying to do my blogging thing again!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;My son graduated from CU Boulder with a BS in Aerospace Engineering.  I am so proud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luca did it!  He finished in four years.  CU Boulder is one of the top Engineering schools and despite COVID he ploughed through it and finished!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/luca-grad.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time he wanted to mine the asteroids.  He was inspired by the Expanse book series.  But along the way he has become convinced that we must be better stewards of Earth, and that we must solve the carbon crisis.  He&amp;rsquo;s taking his Engineering education and is aiming at working with climate and/or ocean science to try to help our &amp;ldquo;spaceship Earth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned.  He&amp;rsquo;s got some interviews lined up, and it&amp;rsquo;s possible he carries on the tradition of some of the work I got to help with 20+ years ago. I hope so!  He may actually build that underwater robot we started in high school after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&amp;rsquo;s an amazing young man.  Much smarter than me.  I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what he does next!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MacOS Ventura - How to set network order</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/macos-ventura/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Apple moved things around in the Network tab in System Settings.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how to set network order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacOS Ventura did again what Apple loves to do: change things.  I swear, there&amp;rsquo;s Product Managers everywhere that just live to change things.  I don&amp;rsquo;t see how anything they did made anything better with the new layout - other than hide things.  The dumbing down of interfaces continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to set the priority order of networks you just need to &amp;ldquo;right-click&amp;rdquo; on one of the networks and you will get a pop-up dialog allowing you to &amp;ldquo;Set Service Order.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/macos-network-order.png&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are using the trackpad it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;ctrl-click&amp;rdquo; by the way.  I always forget that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2711/mac&#34;&gt;Apple Support page&lt;/a&gt; on this is flat out wrong, and others asking on &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/&#34;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; made me think it had been removed and I was furious.  But alas, not removed.  Just hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For no damn good reason.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lessons from Admiral Rickover</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/rickover-lessons/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Admiral Hyman Rickover (1900-1986), the “Father of the Nuclear Navy,” was controversial.  He taught a whole generation of the best Engineers.  Some of my thoughts on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://govleaders.org/rickover.htm&#34;&gt;GovLeaders.org&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admiral Hyman Rickover (1900-1986), the “Father of the Nuclear Navy,” was one of the most successful—and controversial- public managers of the 20th Century. His accomplishments are the stuff of legend. For example, in three short years, Rickover’s team designed and built the first nuclear submarine—the Nautilus—an amazing feat of engineering given that it involved the development of the first use of a controlled nuclear reactor. The Nautilus not only transformed submarine warfare, but also laid the groundwork for a whole fleet of nuclear aircraft carriers and cruisers (which was also built by Rickover and his team).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admiral Rickover passed in 1986, but his impact reached far beyond his grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/rickover.png&#34; width=&#34;40%&#34; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I trained in Rickover&amp;rsquo;s Nuclear Power Program.  I went through Nuclear Power School in Orlando Florida in 1986 and Nuclear Prototype in Idaho Falls, Idaho in early 1987.  I served on the USS Richard B. Russell (SSN-687) from 1987-91.  I qualified Reactor Operator/Shutdown Reactor Operator (RO/SRO) and Engineering Watch Supervisor (EWS).  That experience shaped my whole way of looking at both Engineering &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Engineering Management.  I am who I am today because of those experiences and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/sf.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was the on-watch Reactor Operator when this photograph was taken.  USS Richard B. Russell (SSN-687) circa 1990&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rickovers-seven-rules&#34;&gt;Rickover&amp;rsquo;s Seven Rules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Admiral had Seven Rules.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my notes on how these equaly apply to running a software or SaaS business, with some reflections on my current gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rule-1&#34;&gt;Rule 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have a rising standard of quality over time, and well beyond what is required by any minimum standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Good enough&amp;rdquo; is not good enough.  NOTE:  I did not say be perfect, and I certainly did not say not to strive for &amp;ldquo;good enough to ship.&amp;rdquo;  Those are truths of software.  But you must strive to INCREASE your quality over time.  And that requires constant, unwavering effort and leaders who will demand that things get better.  And better.  And better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rule-2&#34;&gt;Rule 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People running complex systems should be highly capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embedded systems and cloud-based distributed systems are complex by their nature.  I know, I&amp;rsquo;ve built them for my whole career and I lead all the software efforts at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/&#34;&gt;BrightSign&lt;/a&gt; with both embedded linux &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a large cloud footprint (and yes, we are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/about/jobs&#34;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;).  The folks building and running these must be highly capable.  That&amp;rsquo;s worth a whole posting by itself, but I do cover some of my thoughts on this topic in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/about/&#34;&gt;personal management README&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rule-3&#34;&gt;Rule 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervisors have to face bad news when it comes and take problems to a level high enough to fix those problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where a LOT of problems happen.  Bad news is like cheap wine:  it does NOT age well.  Leaders have to be courageous in the face of bad news.  You must appropriately escalate that bad news - to the right level.  This is where JUDGEMENT comes in.  Leaders must have the good judgement to know what problems to escalate, and how high.  A P3 bug needs one level.  Discovering a potential security exploit in your code base is a very different level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rule-4&#34;&gt;Rule 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must have a healthy respect for the dangers and risks of your particular job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/fire.webp&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire in a submarine is terrifying.  It uses all the oxygen and the smoke is toxic.  Fire drills are the most common drill submariners do.  Every week.  Sometimes every day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a SaaS is not physically dangerous.  Since my submarine days I have not had to worry about fighting a fire, plugging a flooding pipe, dealing with a steam rupture, or dealing with radioactive contamination.  Let alone keeping electicity generation and propulsion in a war-fighting situation.  But building software does have risks and dangers.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t catch a critical bug in the embedded firmware, you could lose millions of dollars of revenue or profit when fixing it.  If you miss a security vulnerability your company could get hacked and lose everything.  And the risks go down from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times in my career I have seen a lack of appropriate respect for these dangers and risks.  Some places have been really lucky.  Some have had those risks turn into disaster.  The absolute beginning point of dealing with these is to have a healthy respect for them.  In submarines it was not just respect, but paranoia and obscession.  It was truly a case where what you did not know could kill you.  I may not die from software risks, but I don&amp;rsquo;t want my company to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rule-5&#34;&gt;Rule 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training must be constant and rigorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/flooding.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On submarines, we trained constantly.  This is a &amp;ldquo;wet trainer&amp;rdquo; exercise done in a special training facility.  Practice is critical.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also gets missed.  Teams just assume they can troubleshoot.  They assume that since they built it, they know the system.  You remember about the term &amp;ldquo;assume&amp;rdquo; right?  This has manifested for me quite recently and brutally reminded me that you only know if you can do something if you have actually done it recently.  There is no substitute for practice, and that means actually troubleshooting and repairing problems in your software or SaaS.  AWS does &amp;ldquo;Game Days&amp;rdquo; and I want to look at those again closely.  But we are putting a lot of effort into creating disposable copies of production for testing.  I plan to use that same thing to inject faults into the system and have my team troubleshoot that.  PRACTICE.  There is no substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rule-6&#34;&gt;Rule 6&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the functions of repair, quality control, and technical support must fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking about this a lot as I ponder how to best organize our Engineering resources.  I&amp;rsquo;m rebuilding our QA effort to focus heavily on automation - but especially hiring Software Developers in Test (SDET) instead of just classic QA automation.  And I&amp;rsquo;ve invested in building Swagger/OpenAPI specs and trying to use our own libraries to build our test canaries - and have been doing that work from within our Partner Integration Engineering team.  The folks who support our technology partners should be writing code to use the same APIs.  I find myself wondering where the line is between &amp;ldquo;Development&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;QA&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Partner Support.&amp;rdquo;  Rickover taught me that these all must fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rule-7&#34;&gt;Rule 7&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization and members thereof must have the ability and willingness to learn from mistakes of the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This.  This.  This.  We have started to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://incident.io/&#34;&gt;incident.io&lt;/a&gt; to manage our incidents live, and to have the right data available for a post-mortem.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not enough.  Recently we had an issue that took too long to troubleshoot and fix.  We did a post-mortem.  But have we done all the right review and training, all the way up through management, to ensure that we won&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistakes?  Probably not.  And that&amp;rsquo;s my fault.  That&amp;rsquo;s my job.  Those kinds if things don&amp;rsquo;t happen by accident, and it means I have another important thing on my plate this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/iceberg.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is that what you see regularly is just the tip of the iceberg.  Your status reports, jira backlog, grafana dashboards, whatever - those are all just the surface.  The parts you need to worry about are all the things you cannot see easily.  Knowledge levels.  Skill levels.  Degree your second tier Engineers are able to troubleshoot things (because your top-tier folks may not always be available).  Your database backups that can actually be recovered.  Regional failover.  Key rotations.  Those are all hard to inspect unless you ACTUALLY PRACTICE THEM.  I find myself thinking about this a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admiral Rickover had great lessons to teach (regardless of whether you considered him abrasive or abusive).  Those lessons resonate with me 25 years after I was first exposed to them.  And they apply to software and SaaS just as much as they do to Nuclear Power.  I would argue that they apply to your business too, no matter what that might be.  Some things are just eternal truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest in Peace Admiral.  And thank you. And thanks to all the fine Submarine Officers and Chiefs that carried those lessons onward to the following generations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>No More Twitter</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/no-more-twitter/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 02:21:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/no-more-twitter/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve left Twitter.  You should too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/?lang=en&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; in 2009.  I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for 13 years.  I built a list of folks with interesting things to say.  Military vets.  Technologists.  Politicians.  Educators. People.  I loved it.  I got a lot of news days ahead of other media sources and I learned of things that just never got to me otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now I&amp;rsquo;m gone from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/no-more-twitter.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should consider if it&amp;rsquo;s where you want to stay too.  Or if it&amp;rsquo;s a platform that will still be here in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-leave&#34;&gt;Why Leave?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk.  I already started to &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/goodbye-twitter/&#34;&gt;blog about this earlier&lt;/a&gt;.  This is just more on my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d abandon the platform based purely on how he treated the staff.  On the internet, if you are not paying dollars for a service then YOU are the product.  With the way he did the takeover, I&amp;rsquo;d not contribute myself to making him any money regardless.  He was a giant asshole and he directly harmed thousands of employees, seemingly because he thought he knew better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s worse.  His supposed &amp;ldquo;free speech&amp;rdquo; acts on the platform are actually hate enablement.  The amount of bots, white supremacy, anti-semitism and outright hate speech has exploded on the platform.  Who would stay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;even-before-elon&#34;&gt;Even Before Elon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even before he took over, the algorithm was just feeding me a non-stop pile of things that I did not want to see.  I literally could not block them as fast as they were arriving.  Then it dawned on my:  the algorithm was using my blocks to decide what more to send me!  I am the product!  Maniplulate me!  Make me angry!  Get me to react!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-to-elon-again&#34;&gt;Back to Elon Again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the silly media about how smart Elon is, I say bullshit.  He started rich.  He&amp;rsquo;s never known adversity.  When you have that much money it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to fail.  But we are going to find out now.  I predict &amp;ldquo;Twitter is the new MySpace&amp;rdquo; and we will see if it&amp;rsquo;s still a viable business in a year.  Twitter has &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.npr.org/2022/11/25/1139180002/twitter-loses-50-top-advertisers-elon-musk&#34;&gt;lost 50 of it&amp;rsquo;s top 100 advertisers&lt;/a&gt; since Elon took over.  It was losing money before.  I don&amp;rsquo;t see how it&amp;rsquo;s going to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;rsquo;s truly astonishing that he thinks he understands distributed systems.  Really.  Dude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Elon really risked other people&amp;rsquo;s money.  He&amp;rsquo;s rich.  He may lose some money, but he&amp;rsquo;ll stay rich.  Whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-instead&#34;&gt;What Instead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I&amp;rsquo;ll limit myself to posts on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gherlein/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; when I have something I want to say and get comments back.  I&amp;rsquo;ll use &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/&#34;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; much more.  And I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.  The Twitter replacement is being written, I can promise you that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-mastadon-and-others&#34;&gt;What About Mastadon and Others?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s lots of buzz about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.social/explore&#34;&gt;Mastadon&lt;/a&gt; lately.  I can&amp;rsquo;t see it taking off outside techie circles.  It&amp;rsquo;s too much work.  The techie in me is super intrigued by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr&#34;&gt;nostr&lt;/a&gt; but it&amp;rsquo;s way early days.  I don&amp;rsquo;t see either of them really being the thing yet.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr#the-problem-with-mastodon-and-similar-programs&#34;&gt;This writeup&lt;/a&gt; captures it best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-the-meantime&#34;&gt;In The Meantime?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gherlein/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and putting in more effort here.  I&amp;rsquo;ve deleted the bird from my devices.  And on my computer?  I edited /etc/hosts and added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;127.0.0.1 twitter.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bird is gone.  It&amp;rsquo;s dead to me.  I fervently hope Elon spent $44B for nothing.  My heart aches for all the great Engineers impacted, and especially for the ones who had no choice but to try to stay.  I&amp;rsquo;ve had my back to a wall as well, and I&amp;rsquo;d do anything to save my family and home.  It&amp;rsquo;s a sad part of American capitalism that companies can just do mass layoffs like that and harm so many people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I didn&amp;rsquo;t delete my account.  I&amp;rsquo;m still there.  I don&amp;rsquo;t what someone to take my handle.  I just don&amp;rsquo;t go there anymore.  It really is dead to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;staying-in-touch&#34;&gt;Staying in Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So clearly no more DMs on Twitter.  My linkedIn is to the left, you can send me a message there.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to put a direct email link but you can reach me at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gherlein &amp;lt;at&amp;gt; herlein.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s been my email address since forever ago.  I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know when, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had that domain since before Y2K.  If you want to find me on the Internet, you can.  Just no hate please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-positive&#34;&gt;But Positive!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good will come from this.  The pain will pass.  Something new will rise.  Social media platforms are quite ephemeral.  That&amp;rsquo;s the pattern.  I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see what rises from the ashes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fixing Hugo Scaled Images</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/hugo-images/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 01:21:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/hugo-images/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Hugo broke image rendering.  Well, they made it better, but broke how &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; used it.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Hugo.  Well, I did.  Then I realized that none of my blog images were loading.  Grrrr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/hugo-logo-wide.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing&#34;&gt;Hugo Image Processing&lt;/a&gt; is now the way to do things, apparently.  Not sure when that changed, but I&amp;rsquo;ve not been blogging much this year and certainly not with images.  There&amp;rsquo;s a whole new ecosystem that enables some advanced image processing.  This &lt;a href=&#34;https://mertbakir.gitlab.io/hugo/image-processing-in-hugo/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; seems like a good tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a pain!  I use these kinds of tags a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;img&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;/images/starter.jpeg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;100%&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;/&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The width parameter gives me exactly the control I want to scale my embedded images.  But Hugo changed and no longer supports embeddeding raw HTML in the markdown.  Do I really need to go edit every blog post I have ever done to get new features I don&amp;rsquo;t even need?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait!  There&amp;rsquo;s a trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;workaround&#34;&gt;Workaround&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, actually, just enable it again.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how.  In the config.toml file in the root of your blog, add this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;markup.goldmark.renderer&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  unsafe &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; true
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.  Now Hugo will happily support raw HTML again.  I suppose they had a good reason to turn this off, but it was a pain that cost me 30 minutes of my life this morning.  But then again, I&amp;rsquo;m not paying for Hugo with money.  Open source is paid for with time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the kind author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://radu.link/tips-hugo-beginners/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; guide for Hugo beginners.  Silly, but this is how the internet works.  If you are not constantly paying attention things change and your stuff breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Advice to New Developers (or, How to Get Hired)</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/advice-to-new-developers/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I get asked a lot by new developers:  &amp;ldquo;how do I find a coding job?&amp;rdquo;  What should I do/learn to get a really good job?  Here&amp;rsquo;s my advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in this industry a long time.  My first Linux kernel was before it was 1.0.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been a coder and a manager, and director, and VP.  I currently head all software at BrightSign and I&amp;rsquo;m hiring.  Recently I was in London for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.siliconmilkroundabout.com/&#34;&gt;Silicon MilkRoundabout&lt;/a&gt; recruting event, and I attended the Friday session just for early-in-career folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/siliconmilk.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the son of dear friends had exactly the same question as all those folks.  &amp;ldquo;How do I get hired in software?&amp;rdquo; . Here&amp;rsquo;s my advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-i-actually-do&#34;&gt;What Can I Actually Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-be-afraid&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Be Afraid&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job hunt will feel like a vast wilderness filled with scary beasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/beasts.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid.  Hiring managers are desperate to hire you.  Software does not write itself.  Companies need coders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get out of the mindset that the companies have the power and you have to avoid the monsters to get hired.  NO!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are definitely things you can do to stand out and better prepare yourself to get the best job for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;have-stuff-on-github&#34;&gt;Have Stuff on GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; is the new resume/CV.  Do something and publish it open source.  You don&amp;rsquo;t need to invent the next Linux.  You can just patch a library that you use, or write a new one.  It does not matter what.  Something useful is better, but seriously:  if you have some things on GitHub that show that you can use GitHub and that you can code something, you automatically are ahead of most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;contribute-to-open-source&#34;&gt;Contribute to Open Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This implies that you actually use open source.  Which you do, but if you are not paying attention you may not know it.  Find something you are passionate about and work on it.  See above about using GitHub.  And if you are using something that&amp;rsquo;s open source contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where you will think you are not good enough.  Baloney.  You can make the docs better if nothing else.  Clean up the Makefile.  Add a new description of how it works.  Look in the Issues and find a bug and fix it and submit a Pull Request.  Even if they reject your PR!  You will learn from that, and your work will be seen and be see-able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-the-purpose-of-a-resumecv&#34;&gt;Understand the Purpose of a Resume/CV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your resume/CV is not a document that accurately describes everythign you are or have done.  It&amp;rsquo;s just an advertisement.  For YOU.  It&amp;rsquo;s only purpose is to get a hiring manager interested enough in YOU to want to talk to you.  That&amp;rsquo;s it.  Definitely don&amp;rsquo;t lie.  But there is nothing wrong with editing things so that the most important things TO THE HIRING MANAGER will pop right off the page.  Consider making a version just for the job you are applying for, and focus on addressing every point in the job description for which you have experience.  Seriously.  The person screening your resume (or AI) will be looking for reasons you don&amp;rsquo;t match. Don&amp;rsquo;t give them one.  Match up every point you can.  Yes, this is more work for you.  So?  You want that developer job right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practice-interviews&#34;&gt;Practice Interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practive makes perfect.  Don&amp;rsquo;t go into the one interview for the job you really want and have not practiced.  Seriously.  Spend the time to have someone ask you practice questions.  Read a book on how to interview.  Always repeat the question back and ask clarifying questions.  DO NOT just dive into what you THINK the answer is.  Give yourself a minute, rephrase/repeat the question back.  Then summarize what you know about the solution, then walk through your thoughts as you answer the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time the questions are designed to expose how you THINK, not what you KNOW.  If the interview is a trivia game with short answers you really may not want to work there.  Software is a job that requires problem solving, planning, and then execution.  Don&amp;rsquo;t jump right to execution in the interview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice!  Goodness.  Professional athletes practice their whole life, nearly ever day.  What makes you think you can do well in an interview without practicing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;know-yourself&#34;&gt;Know Yourself&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you want to be a Software Engineer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, seriously.  Is it the money?  Probably not.  You probably fell in love with coding.  You might understand computers better than you do people.  You might love to solve puzzles and coding is the best puzzle.  Whatever it is, KNOW THAT ABOUT YOURSELF.  And be open about talking about it.  The best thing to make you stand out from others is YOU.  You are an interesting human with likes, dislikes, and passions.  Be YOU.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong: you definitely want to be positive.  But have a perspective.  Be genuine.  At the end of the day humans hire other other humans and if you are an interesting human with a perspective and a passion - and especially if that fits the role or the company - then you will stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-should-i-know&#34;&gt;What Should I Know?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-the-linux-command-line-and-scripting&#34;&gt;Understand the Linux Command Line and Scripting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you are applying at Microsoft, you need to know this.  Being fluent at the shell is simply critical these days.  Things in production are not done by point at click (not anywhere you want to work).  It&amp;rsquo;s scripted.  You need to be able to write shell scripts and probably do at least basic things in Python.  This &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line&#34;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on the command line is amazing. Developers these skills are limiting themselves to a tiny fraction of the job market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-containers&#34;&gt;Understand Containers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Containers are the new abstraction layer.  You simply have to know the basics.  There&amp;rsquo;s a million blogs about it but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-beginner-friendly-introduction-to-containers-vms-and-docker-79a9e3e119b/&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; seems simple enough to grok in a few minutes.  I could have picked anything though.  Know the basics of VMs and Containers, what they are for and how to use them.  It&amp;rsquo;s not excusable to not know this in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-the-basics-of-cloud&#34;&gt;Understand the Basics of Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you are ONLY working in mobile or embedded systems you should know the basics.  You don&amp;rsquo;t HAVE to have an AWS or Azure cert (I&amp;rsquo;m ignoring GCP because I predict they won&amp;rsquo;t have a cloud within 3-5 years anyway - Google gets bored and kills product lines).  But you do need to understand the core basics of how things scale using cloud.  You don&amp;rsquo;t absolutely have to grok Kubernetes (k8s).  But you really should understand how VMs are scaled in auto-scaling groups using Load Balancers, how regular databases can scale horizontally using sharding, how static content can be distributed using CDNs, etc.  Know the difference between Block Store and Object Store.  Know what k8s is and what it&amp;rsquo;s advantages are, even if you have never used it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is particularly hard.  But it&amp;rsquo;s surprising to me how few candidates - even for mid-level roles - just don&amp;rsquo;t understand these basics.  Yes, algorithms and data structures are important.  But they don&amp;rsquo;t matter, practically, if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand the building blocks of how modern software is constructed.  You really can&amp;rsquo;t even pretent to be a &amp;ldquo;full stack&amp;rdquo; developer if you don&amp;rsquo;t understand the basics of this.  You should at least grok the how &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;cloud makes things different&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-cap-theorem&#34;&gt;Understand CAP Theorem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also cannot talk about Cloud unless you can talk &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem&#34;&gt;CAP Theorem&lt;/a&gt;.  Consistentcy, Availability, Partition tolerance.  All the cloud stuff above is all about this.  It&amp;rsquo;s the WHY behind how cloud systems are built.  I really like &lt;a href=&#34;https://mwhittaker.github.io/blog/an_illustrated_proof_of_the_cap_theorem/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;An Illustrated Proof of the CAP Theorem&lt;/a&gt; as an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will want to just skip that.  Don&amp;rsquo;t.  Understand it.  You will thank me later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;understand-the-basics-of-distributed-system-desgign&#34;&gt;Understand the Basics of Distributed System Desgign&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is on the road to more advanced, but it&amp;rsquo;s something you need to know soon even if it won&amp;rsquo;t be in your early inteviews.  Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer&#34;&gt;System Design Primer&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s especially amusing these days to think that some folks may (gleefully) ask you to &amp;ldquo;design Twitter&amp;rdquo; in an interview.  This is the culmination of the above two areas, put into practice.  As a junior developer if you have been exposed to those things you are far more likely to be useful right away to a new team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more I could say, but I won&amp;rsquo;t.  If you follow the advice above you will rise to the top of the pack.  It may not be THE THING that gets you the offer, but you will be in the mix for the final decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a mobile/front-end/embedded Engineer then you may think that less of this applies to you. But I would disagree.  The principles above apply to embedded too.  Ever tried to talk to multiple things across an I2C line?  Tell me again how that&amp;rsquo;s not a network?  Mobile has events propogating across multiple listeners.  Tell me again how CAP doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply, at least in principle?  And all three talk to other systems, so all the complexities of distributed systems will apply to how YOUR code works in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this helps you, drop me a note on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gherlein/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.  And yes, you can pay for this advice:  pay it forward.  Someday, you will be a seasoned veteran with years of experience.  Help others out.  Share your knowledge.  Mentor someone.  That&amp;rsquo;s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Git Clone Workaround</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/git-clone-workaround/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 01:30:29 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/git-clone-workaround/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Cloning from GitHub hanging for no apparent reason?  A work-around.  Anyone know why it works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason GitHub has been hanging when cloning new repos.  I did find a workaround that solves it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to make sure your ssh public key is configured in GitHub of course.  Then, edit your .ssh/config file and add:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Host github.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  Hostname ssh.github.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  Port &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;443&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then from the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ssh -T git@github.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then your clones should no longer hang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have yet to understand why this works.  But its working for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t solve this.  I found it &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/Tamal/1cc77f88ef3e900aeae65f0e5e504794&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Kudos to those folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodbye Twitter</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/goodbye-twitter/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/goodbye-twitter/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;After 13.5 years I&amp;rsquo;m no longer using Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-now&#34;&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon.  That&amp;rsquo;s the core of it.  There&amp;rsquo;s every indication he will do what he says and allow hate to take over the platform.  The thing most (WhiteNationalists/GOP/GQP) don&amp;rsquo;t understand about free speech is that you are not free to lie with impunity.  Just like you can&amp;rsquo;t shout &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; in a crowded theatre, you also can&amp;rsquo;t spew hate that then inspires violence and have zero consequenes.  If Twitter banned you, it was because you violated their stated policies.  Elon didn&amp;rsquo;t like it and had $44 BILLION dollars so he bought the platform so he could allow the hate.  Makes you wonder how he was raised, no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump lost.  That&amp;rsquo;s an established fact that anyone that actually looks at the evidence understands.  It&amp;rsquo;s been tested in court dozens of times - and every single time Trump lost the case.  The election was not stolen.  Trump being allowed to go back on Twitter is a danger to our country - at least to the chance of civilized conversation.  The fact that Elon wants to let him back on is enough to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I also am just tired of blocking all the liars.  Every day there&amp;rsquo;s another person spewing hate and lies.  It&amp;rsquo;s made it impossible to do what I like to do on Twitter:  follow interesting tech trends and people, and stay in touch with people I share interests with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty shitty to lose Twitter.  I already deleted my Facebook account years ago, after also leaving it for a time.  It&amp;rsquo;s just filled with hate.  I have no time for all the hate.  I&amp;rsquo;m tired of ugly people being nasty to others because of the color of their skin, or where they came from, or what language they speak, or who they are sexually attracted to.  Those are not reasons to hate someone.  Those are reasons to get to know someone, and learn from them.  It&amp;rsquo;s our differences that make the world interesting.  Why can&amp;rsquo;t most folks just mind their own damn business?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;forever&#34;&gt;Forever?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who knows.  I know I don&amp;rsquo;t have the energy for the hate I expect on Twitter.  So I just won&amp;rsquo;t log on there for a long while.  I think we will all know more about how things are going to play out after the mid-terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if things go sideways with a lot of hate I&amp;rsquo;ll delete my Twitter account.  For now, it&amp;rsquo;s there.  I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to go read it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;staying-in-touch&#34;&gt;Staying in Touch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So clearly no more DMs on Twitter.  My linkedIn is to the left, you can send me a message there.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to put a direct email link but you can reach me at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gherlein &amp;lt;at&amp;gt; herlein.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s been my email address since forever ago.  I don&amp;rsquo;t actually know when, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had that domain since before Y2K.  If you want to find me on the Internet, you can.  Just no hate please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>September Update</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/september/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:00:01 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/september/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Three months since I posted, so here&amp;rsquo;s some random thoughts and updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly three months at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/&#34;&gt;BrightSign&lt;/a&gt; now.  Loving it, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly more than I thought it was.  It&amp;rsquo;s a large staff with code that spans from low-level Linux kernel and media rendering stuff all the way up to large cloud backends.  The Electron/React parts are newer to me, but I grew to really like Typescript at AWS and we have loads of that too.  In short, it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to get bored.  In fact, I wish I could clone myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I write this I&amp;rsquo;m in home quarantine.  Yes, COVID again.  I probably picked it up traveling last week.  I was in the UK for nearly a month, moving my daughter into her new flat and then spending time with my teams in Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/math-bridge-cambride.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that Cambridge.  Not the newer one.  The one with buildings that were holding college classes before Columbus sailed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;musings-on-automation&#34;&gt;Musings on Automation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice to any company is automate early.  If you approach it later in the company timeline, you will find a lot more sharp edges that make it slower.  Not impossible, but slower.  Constantly work to automate everything you can.  That&amp;rsquo;s the game anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-my-big-goals&#34;&gt;What Are My Big Goals?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ready a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/adcock_brett/status/1573719801536471041?s=11&amp;t=TwZabZf-Y0oiqLnWQv_QwA&#34;&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; today about growing a company.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the tl;dr I got from it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make the product better.  What can we do today to make things the best they can be in 2-3 years?  Hey points:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the highest impact areas to focus on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can you de-scope and move faster?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can the product improve?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can the team be more efficient?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a shared vision?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is absolutely true and a great North Star.  But you also have to make sure your processes and foundations are ready for it.  And that they are consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making software is hard.  Making it efficiently is harder.  Doing that at scale is harder still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s the game, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s all for now.  Just wanted to drop something new so folks know I&amp;rsquo;m still kicking. If you are reading this drop me a note by email, DM or LI message.  It&amp;rsquo;s always nice to hear from folks!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s old is new again:  I&amp;rsquo;ve joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/&#34;&gt;BrightSign&lt;/a&gt; as their Head of Software Engineering!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten years ago, right after I left Rackspace, I joined BrightSign for a year as a consultant.  It didn&amp;rsquo;t work out to join them as an employee back then, and I went on to be VP Engineering at Cognitive Networks and then spent six years at Cisco as an Engineering Director, and then the last 18 months at AWS.  But what is old is new again, and this time I&amp;rsquo;ve joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/&#34;&gt;BrightSign&lt;/a&gt; as their Head of Software Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/brightsign.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-brightsign-do&#34;&gt;What Does BrightSign Do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrightSign is the market leader in digital signage players.  I used them professionally when I was VP Engineering at PRN back in the day, so I&amp;rsquo;m well aware of how bullet-proof they are.  They have continued that legacy and are making even more powerful players, such as their just announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/digital-signage-products/XC-product-line&#34;&gt;XC5 Players&lt;/a&gt; that rival high-end PCs.  Combined with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/bsncloud/bsncloud&#34;&gt;BSN.cloud&lt;/a&gt; offering and the ability to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/partners/integrated-solutions#CMS_Partners&#34;&gt;integrate into other CMS&lt;/a&gt; they are poised for substantial growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-ill-do&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ll Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll head all software development, Integration Engineering, DevOps, and QA.  What exactly does that mean?  I&amp;rsquo;m not 100% sure since I just started!  I&amp;rsquo;ve spent tens of hours so far with thier &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffhastings1/&#34;&gt;CEO Jeff Hastings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-blundell-9511698b/&#34;&gt;VP Engineering Phil Blundell&lt;/a&gt; discussing their business and aspirations.  But there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like getting into it personally.  You can&amp;rsquo;t learn to swim by talking or reading.  You have to dive into the water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yes-im-hiring&#34;&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m Hiring!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing most folks ask is &amp;ldquo;are you hiring?&amp;rdquo; which is really silly these days.  Yes of course!  Even with the economy, anyone building software is hiring. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/about/jobs&#34;&gt;Check out the list of open roles&lt;/a&gt; and ping me if anything looks interesting to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wait-you-left-aws&#34;&gt;Wait&amp;hellip; You Left AWS?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.  I loved the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/&#34;&gt;Amazon Chime SDK&lt;/a&gt; team and product.  I think they are poised for a breakout year, especially in telephony.  If you want to connect voice to Amazon ML services, then you should be using the Amazon Chime SDK.  It&amp;rsquo;s just too easy.  If you have phones and your customers call you, you probably need the Amazon Chime SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But alas, BrightSign has wanted to hire me for a long time, and Jeff finally got me.  It&amp;rsquo;s time.  And I get to lead a product team again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-why-now&#34;&gt;But Why Now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrightSign has a tremendous product line and a successful cloud offering.  They are poised for a breakout year as well.  Their new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.brightsign.biz/digital-signage-products/XC-product-line&#34;&gt;XC5 player&lt;/a&gt; enables a whole new world of applications that previously required a PC.  Back at PRN my teams managed a network of 50,000 players. I can tell you that rolling trucks to fix players costs too much.  PRNs Checkout TV platform was PC based, and even at ~10 PCs per store and hundreds of stores it was simply not economically viable.  Had we had BrightSign players then we could have dramatically scaled that line of business.  And if you want the bells and whistles that today&amp;rsquo;s graphics demand you are in a bind.  But BrightSign has done the hard Engineering to make a true embedded system media player that has PC-level capabilities.  This will change the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was well aware at PRN that our ability to scale our digital signage business was limited to what retailers we could get under contract to deploy our network into.  We had our own CMS software and a fully capable company built out.  But scaling was slow, and the money we spent developing that CMS was substantial.  BrightSign has their own CMS offering that&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine for many applications.  But today there are dozens of companies building CMS tools for signage, because there is no &amp;ldquo;one size fits all.&amp;rdquo;  No one can have all the features in one software platform suitable for the very wide number of use cases in signage.  BrightSign has a way for all those CMS vendors to easily integrate with the player, making it almost as if the BrightSign player was built for their platform.  This makes BrightSign even more ubiquitous.  The opportunity is huge, but the software has to be world-class.  That&amp;rsquo;s what I was hired to do:  scale out the software team and help drive all the &amp;ldquo;ilities&amp;rdquo; (reliability, scalability, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-on-deck&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s on Deck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud, baby!  And scale!  Stay tuned.  Oh, did I say I was hiring?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Locked Myself Out of my Linux System</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/locked-out-and-locked-up/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2022 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/locked-out-and-locked-up/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Imagine my surprise when I could not sudo!  Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First the back story: I had to reboot my linux notebook this morning because it had locked up.  I went back to Ubuntu for a working desktop linux machine because I was having trouble with Debian and a second monitor and I was in a hurry.  It would lock up once in a few weeks on Debian, but it locked up three times yesterday.  Anyway, went to check if &lt;em&gt;this time&lt;/em&gt; maybe it logged something and suddenly my terminal tells me that I am not in the sudoers file.  Wait.  What?  How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First clue was that I did &amp;ldquo;id&amp;rdquo; and found that I was really only in one group (video).  I knew for a fact that could not be right.  So that was causing it (no membership in the sudo group) but how?  To find that out I needed to get my root priveledges back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Ubuntu boot screens are for the masses, not for geeks, so they took out the GRUB menu.  You need to press &amp;ldquo;shift&amp;rdquo; during boot to get that to pop up.  In GRUB you can select to boot in recovery mode, and then drop to a root shell, and then remount with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mount -o remount,rw /
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then edit the /etc/group file.  Reboot.  OK, now I am back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-i-hacked&#34;&gt;Was I Hacked?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually afraid for a moment that I had been insidiously hacked.  Nope.  Just my own ignorance.  I had shot myself in the foot with a command and it was not until a reboot that I found it.  Because, after all, you only re-read your group memberships after you log out and back in (or reboot).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-did-i-do-wrong&#34;&gt;What Did I Do (Wrong)?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had been playing with &amp;ldquo;v4l2-ctl&amp;rdquo; to adjust my camera settings in meetings.  Works like a charm, and far more reliable than apps on the Mac.  But to run it you need to be a member of the video group.  So I had added myself to the video group but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to reboot, so I just did a quick command and then &amp;ldquo;sudo - gherlein&amp;rdquo; to reload my session without logging out and back in.  What was the command?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;usermod -G gherlein video
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vanilla right?  Easy.  The experienced admins out there just winced.  They spotted it right away.  Me?  Nope.  Running too fast, not ninja-level on my SysAdmin commands anymore I guess.  What I just told the system to do was to add me to the video group AND ONLY THAT GROUP.  What I SHOULD have done was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;usermod -aG gherlein video
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;which does an APPEND that group, maintining all other memberships.  One letter, and I managed to lock myself out of admin rights on my own computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from &amp;ldquo;cargo cult programming&amp;rdquo; advice of making certain you know what every command does when you do it as root, the big lesson I am reminded of is that with Linux you can almost always fix it.  You can boot back to a mode where with skills (and the sometimes help of a Google search) you can restore your computer to working.  So don&amp;rsquo;t panic!  Love Linux!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-to-the-freezing&#34;&gt;Back to the Freezing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I had sudo rights again I could actually look at syslog.  Nothing at all useful in the logs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jun &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;17&lt;/span&gt; 21:18:10 alien dbus-daemon&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;664&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;system&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Successfully activated service &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;org.freedesktop.nm_dispatcher

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jun &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;18&lt;/span&gt; 05:15:44 alien systemd&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;: Starting Flush Journal to Persistent Storage...
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smells like a hardware problem.  Definitely happens more often now that I am using this same machine as a desktop.  Ran the hardware tests and they came up clean, so it does not seem to be a RAM problem.  I read that sometimes an SSD failure can manifest like this (but that seems weird) but really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;working-hypothesis&#34;&gt;Working Hypothesis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m betting it&amp;rsquo;s the GPU.  Playing video in the browser seems to be the thing that I am doing now that I was not doing before, so I disabled hardware acceleration in Chrome.  I also removed a lot of the Chrome extensions I had installed.  If I did not remember using it, out.  Chrome is easily the most demanding thing I run all the time so let&amp;rsquo;s unload things it does not need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know.  I would really like to make this machine work as my working desktop.  My new job (oops, not announcing that) shipped me a new MBP 16&amp;quot; M1 that should be a screamer, so I may end up using that mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was editing that last paragraph my system froze again.  And of course I had not saved my work.  I was preparing to be pissed (and really disappointed) but in line with the theme above I did a quick search.  Lo and behold, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://datarecoverypit.com/recover-vs-code-files/&#34;&gt;recover unsaved files from VS Code.&lt;/a&gt;.  So gentle reader, you are reading this because someone smart made a way to keep work saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s causing my notebook to freeze up.  More troubleshooting is needed.  But there&amp;rsquo;s a farmers market to go to, flank steak to grill, and good friends to pour some bubbly for.  Fixing this computer may just have to wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update2&#34;&gt;UPDATE2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It locked up AGAIN but this time I saw the main LCD screen go nuts right before it froze.  So it&amp;rsquo;s DEFINITELY something with the GPU.  A bit of googling and found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/l2j8kk/psa_if_your_system_freezes_randomly_and_you_have/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; that said to downgrade the NVidia drivers (and found &amp;hellip;) AND IT LOCKED UP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I purged all Nvidia drivers and reinstalled.  For the observant reader wondering why I am keeping a buggy proprietary driver, it&amp;rsquo;s because the external HDMI port is only supported using the Nvidia driver for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still trying.  But it&amp;rsquo;s getting more than annoying to have my working machine lock up every few minutes.  It&amp;rsquo;s reminding me of the old days on Linux (and I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for that shit today).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/AWS-Cookbook-Recipes-Success/dp/1492092606/ref=sr_1_1?crid=10TVQCJGZ2FWA&amp;keywords=aws+cookbook&amp;qid=1654968145&amp;sprefix=aws+cookbook%2Caps%2C111&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;The AWS Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; is a must have addition to your reference library.  Disclaimer:  I received a free copy of this book from the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Culkin read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/networking-book-review/&#34;&gt;review I did&lt;/a&gt; of Linux Networking and reached out to me and asked what I thought of his book on AWS.  He was nice enough to send me a copy.  Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve read it, I would happily pay for it.  He and Mike Zazon did a great job.  They provide a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/awscookbook&#34;&gt;git repo&lt;/a&gt; too, but it looks to me like it only has the cleanup scripts, not the how to scripts.  That makes commercial sense.  If they&amp;rsquo;d have put all of it in the repo then why buy the book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/aws-cookbook.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-liked&#34;&gt;What I Liked&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is practical.  It&amp;rsquo;s a cookbook, but the best kind: the kind you use all the time.  It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-Fully-Revised-Updated/dp/1501169718/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2942C95GBJ8JL&amp;keywords=joy+of+cooking&amp;qid=1655043744&amp;sprefix=joy+of+cooking%2Caps%2C122&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Joy of Cooking&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; of AWS books.  It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;problem&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; approach.  You can either grab this when you have a problem and can look up how to solve it (cleanly documented) or just read it and learn as you go.  I remember learning Unix in a similar way by reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Power-Tools-Third-Shelley-Powers/dp/0596003307/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2S5FRNYTVAKUW&amp;keywords=unix+power+tools&amp;qid=1655043900&amp;sprefix=unix+power+tools%2Caps%2C117&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;Unix Power Tools&lt;/a&gt;.  Spending time reading this book will make you a better cloud Engineer.  Period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also really like that it&amp;rsquo;s all aws command line.  This book is about showing you how to do it with the most universal, repeatable, consistent way.  No AWS console.  No language specific solution.  Just good old command lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch for the scorpion symbols.  Those point out places where you can get badly stung.  These may be where the book is the most valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wishes&#34;&gt;Wishes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish all the reciptes were available on GitHub!  That would have been amazing.  But alas, writing a book is a LOT of work and John and Mike deserve to get compensated for their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-thought--certification-study&#34;&gt;Another Thought:  Certification Study&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have all three of the AWS Associate level certifications.  They are a badge that basically says one has achieved a certain level of knowledge.  Not that you know how to apply that knowledge, just that you have the knowledge.  As I was reading through recipes it occured to me more than once &amp;ldquo;oh, that was in my SysOps cert study and now I see how it really works.&amp;rdquo;  If you want to really boost what you get out of AWS certification study, this book can really help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy this book.  It will make you better, and it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time until you need one of the recipes.  Having it at hand will save you hours of work.  Time is the one thing you can never get back, and this book will save you time.  I love it.  I think you will too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review: Linux for Networking Professionals</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/networking-book-review/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: read the web instead of &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Linux-Networking-Professionals-configure-enterprise-ebook/dp/B09BZTLRKY&#34;&gt;Linux for Networking Professionals&lt;/a&gt;.  This book is a broad, shallow coverage that is probably more easily learned from web pages for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love networking.  I love Linux.  So I was pretty excited to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Linux-Networking-Professionals-configure-enterprise-ebook/dp/B09BZTLRKY&#34;&gt;Linux for Networking Professionals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/book.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short review:  don&amp;rsquo;t waste your money or your time.  There&amp;rsquo;s nothing here, really, that you cannot get reading web pages.  I was hoping for some in-depth material but it&amp;rsquo;s basically just shallow treatment of the basics.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing this too long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-this-book-is-for&#34;&gt;Who This Book is For&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Linux and perhaps come from a networking background and you want a fast overview, this book might be a good fit.  But it&amp;rsquo;s really a &amp;lsquo;100&amp;rsquo; level treatment in my opinion and you will find yourself going to the web to read more anyway.  Why not just start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;better-recommendations&#34;&gt;Better Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book basically was just operational commands.  If that&amp;rsquo;s all you want, go here:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-ip-command-examples&#34;&gt;https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-ip-command-examples&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For deeper information, here&amp;rsquo;s a few good pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cs.unh.edu/cnrg/people/gherrin/linux-net.html&#34;&gt;Linux IP Networking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tldp.org/LDP/tlk/net/net.html&#34;&gt;LDP Article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while it&amp;rsquo;s not Linux-specific, the bible for understanding networking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/TCP-Illustrated-Protocols-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0321336313/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12VY8UBX7UNKY&amp;keywords=tcpip+illustrated&amp;qid=1653225582&amp;sprefix=tcpip+illu%2Caps%2C126&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1: The Protocols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/TCP-IP-Illustrated-Implementation-Vol/dp/020163354X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=12VY8UBX7UNKY&amp;keywords=tcpip+illustrated&amp;qid=1653225582&amp;sprefix=tcpip+illu%2Caps%2C126&amp;sr=8-4&#34;&gt;TCP/IP Illustrated: The Implementation, Vol. 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/TCP-Illustrated-Transactions-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0201634953/ref=sr_1_6?crid=12VY8UBX7UNKY&amp;keywords=tcpip+illustrated&amp;qid=1653225582&amp;sprefix=tcpip+illu%2Caps%2C126&amp;sr=8-6&#34;&gt;TCP/IP Illustrated: v. 3: TCP for Transactions, HTTP, NNTP and the Unix Domain Protocols&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should have known.  Oh well, at least Amazon let me return it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DevOps: Manage the Cognitive Load</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/cognitive-load/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2022 00:00:01 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/cognitive-load/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Speed, cost and quality are considered the vectors that you can control.  If you are moving to cloud to get the &amp;ldquo;ilities&amp;rdquo; that comprise quality, you need to seriously consider Cognitive Load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of different software architectures and systems at a lot of companies.  Every team and system has it&amp;rsquo;s own history, it&amp;rsquo;s own technical debt, it&amp;rsquo;s own velocity and set of capabilities.  Some teams are staffed more completely than others.  Some are farther along the cloud journey than others.  Some have people with more current skills than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s not often discussed or evaluated is the level of &amp;ldquo;Cognitive Load&amp;rdquo; the team has to carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-define-cogntive-load&#34;&gt;How I Define Cogntive Load&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Load is the sum total of all the knowledge and understanding needed in order to do your job.  It&amp;rsquo;s going to include the base eduction that got you to where you are at, and it includes all the new material you need to understand how your job is changing.  Some jobs have huge amounts of knowledge needed but don&amp;rsquo;t change that fast.  I used to be a nuclear power plant operator and supervisor on a US Navy submarine.  It took two years of training before I stepped onto the boat, and generally it takes another year to be fully qualified.  But then it did not change all that fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/sf.jpg&#34; width=&#34;80%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your job is building and/or operating today&amp;rsquo;s software then you have both a massive amount of residual knowledge needed AND it&amp;rsquo;s changing incredibly fast.  If your job includes migrating software to cloud, then it&amp;rsquo;s a double load: you need to know how the current system works, and you also need to understand all the cloud technology needed for how your system will work in the cloud.  If your software is written in, say, Java, and you are porting it to golang then it&amp;rsquo;s a double load:  you need to know the Java ecosystem and also the golang tools and ecosystem.  If you are moving from VMs to containers, same thing.  All of those vectors of change are not additive.  They are multiplicative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, companies are moving towards &amp;ldquo;Cloud Native&amp;rdquo; architectures.  Which usually means Kubernetes (k8s).  Which itself then implies containers.  And a new monitoring system, probably oriented around &amp;ldquo;observability.&amp;rdquo;  And often it includes moving to a &amp;ldquo;streaming&amp;rdquo; data injest model, possibly with kafka or Amazon Kinesis or the like.  And if you are going there, you almost certainly want to adopt a &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; posture, meaning using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).  That means you also need automated, continuous testing, and almost certainly a whole new set of automation tools.  Jenkins may have served you well deploying to long-lived servers in a data center, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a poor fit if you are doing k8s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/brain.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOOM.  The brain explodes.  This is a LOT of material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;managing-the-load&#34;&gt;Managing the Load&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product management is about planning what your product needs to do in order to be of the most value to customers.  It usually includes planning trade offs in the development of that product, usually trying to deliver useful bits of the product incrementally, usually adapting the product as you gain experience and customer feedback.  Engineering designs the archicture and builds the product. Management plans the funding, staffing, and work efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;YOU MUST ALSO MANAGE THE COGNITIVE LOAD.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your teams have to learn a lot of material, and there is no &amp;ldquo;one size fits all&amp;rdquo; approach to up-skilling your teams.  It&amp;rsquo;s a learning journey.  Building the new architecture is a journey too, usually refactoring the software, shifting parts into micro-services, decoupling sub-systems, doing a &amp;ldquo;strangler fig&amp;rdquo; approach to untangle your monolith.  That takes planning.  The learning journey to cope with the cognitive load also takes planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t underestimate this.  I personally have seen a project get into trouble because the team did not invest enough in how they were going to operate a new technology.  If you think you can just adopt something like kafka and it &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; then you are going to have a bad quarter.  You have to plan how your teams are going to learn all the new tech.  You have to plan for the cognitive load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;optimization-and-choices&#34;&gt;Optimization and Choices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the vectors:  speed, cost, quality.  The old saying is &amp;ldquo;pick any two.&amp;rdquo;  Quality is the sum of all the &amp;ldquo;ilities&amp;rdquo; (reliability, sustainability, operability, scalability, etc.).  Adopting new cloud technology is to get you those &amp;ldquo;ilities.&amp;rdquo;  But clearly doing so will slow you down, and cost you more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do have some choices.  You can choose how fast you adopt new technologies, and which technologies.  If you move to containers, do you really need to jump right to k8s?  Can you consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/&#34;&gt;Docker Swarm?&lt;/a&gt;.  What about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nomadproject.io/&#34;&gt;Hashicorp Nomad&lt;/a&gt; instead?  Both have substantially lower learning curves.  Can you spread the change over a longer period?  What really is driving your need to make the changes in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and adopt change.  But consider the time to learn, training costs, and most importantly learning to OPERATE the new technology.  Does your team know how to troubleshoot it when it fails?  How do you recover?  Have you actually practiced that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams have a certain amount of energy they are able to deliver.  Some companies try to push teams harder to get more energy delivered per unit time, but ultimately the energy a team has is finite.  Some of that energy will be spent learning the new technologies.  You may be able to hire some new talent who already have the skills, but even that takes time.  And money.  There is a talent war going on.  In all likelyhood you will need to up-skill your existing teams.  And that means making careful choices about how much Cognitive Load you are taking on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Clicky Web Analytics with Hugo</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/clicky/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I added &lt;a href=&#34;https://clicky.com/&#34;&gt;Clicky&lt;/a&gt; web analytics to my blog (running &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;hugo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was ridiculously easy to do, documented here for posterity.  I signed up for an account and they provided a chunk of HTML to be added to the web site.  I just dropped it into the pages I want to track at the bottom and it just worked.  One site is free, up to 3000 page views a day.  I doubt I get 1/10th that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be fun to see if this thing is getting read.  Folks tell me they read it so I&amp;rsquo;m guessing someone does. Now I&amp;rsquo;ll know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instrument everything!  Measure it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Trials:  ESP32-POE-EA Board from Olimex</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32-poe-ea-first-trials/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 15 May 2022 00:00:01 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Tl/Dr:  It&amp;rsquo;s on the network!  But in my analysis, I fell victim to my own bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picking up from last weekend, I play with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-POE/open-source-hardware&#34;&gt;ESP32-POE-EA board from Olimex&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/freertos-smp.html&#34;&gt;Espressif FreeRTOS ESP-IDF Framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get started, I want to give an unsolicited plug to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Mair&#34;&gt;Mair Seartz&lt;/a&gt; for his &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnesp32.com/&#34;&gt;excellent video tutorial on ESP32 programming&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s on sale for $49 and it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.  I&amp;rsquo;ve got books and read web pages and even built some things, but dang, a few hours with his videos and I am vastly more knowledgable.  And he showed me some thing I flat out did not know that changed my development.  If you want to do ESP32, go watch his courses.  That&amp;rsquo;s my heartfelt advice.  He has no idea I&amp;rsquo;m plugging him, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the gadget:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/esp32-poe-ea.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it&amp;rsquo;s on the network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;1913&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; eth_example: Ethernet Started

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OLIMEX/ESP32-POE&#34;&gt;vanilla code from Olimex.&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OLIMEX/ESP32-POE/tree/master/SOFTWARE/ESP-IDF/ESP32_PoE_Ethernet_IDFv4.4&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started-really-understanding&#34;&gt;Getting Started Really Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got it to compile and run, but to really grok how it works I decided to build a clean new app based off the official samples.  ESP32 has example code for Ethernet, geared towards their &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-ethernet-kit.html&#34;&gt;Ethernet Kit&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the nifty things I learned from &lt;a href=&#34;https://learnesp32.com/&#34;&gt;learn32.com&lt;/a&gt; was how to create a sample app easily in Visual Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside Visual Code, hit F1 and search for &amp;ldquo;ESP-IDF: Show Example Projects&amp;rdquo; and select your installed ESP-IDF folder as the source.  You can pick any of them and create a sample app directly from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/new-sample-proj.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I did that and then started to compare it to the Olimex example.  My process on this included opening an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OLIMEX/ESP32-POE/issues/30&#34;&gt;issue in the Olimex git repo&lt;/a&gt; that has a bad link&amp;hellip; and basically says nothing useful.  It does compile and run, assuming you use the right version of the ESP-IDF framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-how-is-this-different&#34;&gt;But How is This Different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oof.  It&amp;rsquo;s very different.  Right off I compared the sdkconfig files and painstakingly changed them on the new side.  I&amp;rsquo;m unclear on a few things, like this difference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;CONFIG_EXAMPLE_ETH_PHY_LAN8720&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;y     |CONFIG_EXAMPLE_ETH_PHY_LAN87XX&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;y
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(that was created with &amp;lsquo;diff -wy&amp;rsquo; by the way).  Probably chalk it up to improvements in making the official code more generic, and the Olimex code is a snapshot in time of the official code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I got all the changes to match, but alas, it just crashes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;382&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; system_api: read default base MAC address from EFUSE

&lt;p&gt;I stupidly thought that the source code would be the same as the example code, but on reflection that does not make sense.  Of course it&amp;rsquo;s different.  This isn&amp;rsquo;t Linux!  On a real OS all the hardware is abstracted completely away from you.  Swap a NIC card, no worries.  The CODE is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That exposed a bias on my part:  I am so used to Linux that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to look at the source.  Configs sure, since those tell the system what the hardware is.  But alas, at the level of the real-time OS your code has to change too, to match the new hardware.  A quick diff and oh my.  There&amp;rsquo;s some stuff to unpack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Olimex board is using the onboard EMAC but an &lt;a href=&#34;https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/00002164B.pdf&#34;&gt;external LAN8720 transceiver&lt;/a&gt;.  Looks like it uses 3 GPIO to control it and &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v4.4/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/spi_master.html&#34;&gt;SPI&lt;/a&gt; for the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not in a crazy rush to build something on a deadline.  I&amp;rsquo;m doing this because it&amp;rsquo;s fun, and it scratches a deep itch inside me to code, to learn, to hack, to build stuff.  So my next step is to really dig into this code and understand what it is doing.  I love networking - been doing it my whole career - and now instead of hacking on packets I&amp;rsquo;m going to hack on the PHY layer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-might-this-go&#34;&gt;Where Might This Go?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olimex has an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OLIMEX/ESP32-POE/tree/master/SOFTWARE/ESP-IDF/ESP32-PoE_Eth_to_AP_v4.4&#34;&gt;example WiFi Access Point&lt;/a&gt; using this hardware.  Now, that&amp;rsquo;s the last thing I need to build.  I have a box full of them in my basement, left over from when I replaced my &lt;a href=&#34;https://openwrt.org/&#34;&gt;OpenWRT&lt;/a&gt; system with &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-network-unifi-os-consoles&#34;&gt;Ubiquity Unifi equipment&lt;/a&gt;.  But, the goal here is not really to understand it at a deep level.  You know, to HACK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-might-this-have-all-come-from&#34;&gt;Where Might This Have All Come From?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History!  Even those who understand history might be doomed to repeat it.  Way back, way way WAY back, I did something similar.  Back when dinosaurs where still around.  You know, in 1996 or so.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3030&#34;&gt;Here is an article I wrote for the Linux Journal&lt;/a&gt; where we used a spread-spectrum radio well before we had WiFi standards.  It worked fantastic!  When I built that I submitted bug fixes to the Linux kernel (for RS-485 drivers) and was completely comfortable with how every component in the system worked at a deep level.  Those days are behind me in my day job now (for now, at least) so the chance to dive that deep on a hobby project is really satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-what-are-you-building&#34;&gt;But What Are You Building?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an underground cistern without a water gauge.  If the cistern gets low the pump float switch will prevent it from running (to save the pump).  So when I have no water pressure, is it due to low water level (e.g. someone used it faster than the city water pressure could refill it) or do I have some other problem?  What I really need is a water level gauge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a drawer full of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf&#34;&gt;HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Modules&lt;/a&gt; from robotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/hc-sr04.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cover of the cistern is concrete and steel.  I very much doubt that I can get WiFi down there.  But I can run an Ethernet cable and do POE and data over it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already tried &lt;a href=&#34;https://esp32.com/viewtopic.php?t=25865&#34;&gt;someone elses example code&lt;/a&gt; and found it pretty easy.  Calibration will be a big deal though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal established.  Learn.  Hack.  Oh, and get a notice if the water level drops below a certain point so I can tell folks to go easy unless they want to be thirsty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an older &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-GATEWAY/open-source-hardware&#34;&gt;Olimex ESP32 Gateway&lt;/a&gt; board in my parts bin.  I found it while looking to see if I had a suitable JTAG adapter (I don&amp;rsquo;t, so I ordered &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/ubld-FIDDY-Plus-FT2232H-Interface/dp/B091MDFHH3/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ft2232h+jtag&amp;qid=1652641591&amp;sprefix=ft2232%2Caps%2C129&amp;sr=8-3&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;).  I built the same code and installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND IT WORKED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ESP32-gateway.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;transform:rotate(270deg);&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I pulled out the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-EVB/open-source-hardware&#34;&gt;ESP32=EVB-EA-IND&lt;/a&gt; board that I bought with the POE board and tried it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/ESP32-EVB.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34; style=&#34;transform:rotate(270deg);&#34;/&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AND IT WORKED.  Which is not too surprising.  Olimex has a standard design and they are sticking to it.  Good to see.  Now I have three boards that have the same hardware!  And they are readily available, and the hardware is open source.  That&amp;rsquo;s really remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Playing like it was summer (but with an ESP32)</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/back-to-the-future/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Been awhile, head spinning, took some time to just play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been doing too much other things that clouded my head.  Not bad, but I just wanted something to poke at for me.  You know.  Just something I wanted to play with.  I&amp;rsquo;m not 9 years old, but I felt like it earlier.  I just wanted to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I cracked open something that arrived before the pandemic.  It&amp;rsquo;s another ESP32 variant board, this time the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.olimex.com/Products/IoT/ESP32/ESP32-POE/open-source-hardware&#34;&gt;ESP32-OEM-EA&lt;/a&gt; from Olimex.  It&amp;rsquo;s basically a POE ESP32 with Wifi/BLE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/esp32-poe-ea.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea if I&amp;rsquo;m going to build something with this, but my son got accepted into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.glee2023.org/&#34;&gt;GLEE Moon Mission&lt;/a&gt; project and will be building a 5 gram sensor board that goes to the moon.  So what the hell?  I may need to brush off the dust on some of these tools and skills to help him, so let&amp;rsquo;s play with the toys that make me forget what time it is and take me back to why I wanted to do this career in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it.  Nothing to speak of.  Made a clean build vagrant.  Installed tools.  Hello world running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a little while, it was like summertime as a kid again.  Maybe tomorrow I&amp;rsquo;ll make it actually do something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, it&amp;rsquo;s just a hello summer (er, hello world). And who knows, maybe all my spirals will bring me back to this for my project on the pool and weather station.  Back to the future, again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making Prometheus Alert Manager (more) Consistent</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Prometheus Alert Manager is an &amp;ldquo;AP&amp;rdquo; system, in &amp;ldquo;CAP&amp;rdquo; terms.  How we made it more Consistent, including a forked repo of the Alert Manager code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is not new.  My good friend and former colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcwangmit01/&#34;&gt;David Wang &lt;/a&gt; spoke at CloudSphere in Krakow Poland in late 2019.  The recording is:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHHvX5HloYQ&#34;&gt;CloudSphere: Impedance Matching Legacy Apps to Prometheus Monitoring by Greg Herlein &amp;amp; David Wang&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m setting up &lt;a href=&#34;https://prometheus.io/&#34;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; again for some home monitoring and I realized I&amp;rsquo;d never blogged about it, really, beyond a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/sphereit/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that merely had a link to the recording. The overall problem was super interesting so it&amp;rsquo;s worth a few notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas 2018 (actually December 26): my phone rings.  It&amp;rsquo;s the head of Cisco Advanced Services in Japan, and he wanted to know if I knew anything about &amp;ldquo;SRE.&amp;rdquo;  I told him that I managed a team of SREs, trying to bring an SRE mindset to the core software team in Cisco Customer Experinece (CX), so yes, in fact, I think I did.  Cisco had a customer in Japan deploying a huge cloud-native, fully virtualized 5G mobile phone network and their CTO was asking if Cisco could share our perspective and help them organize an SRE team.  Long story short, I was on a plane to Tokyo the next week and earned the customers trust.  Myself and a few of my team were loaned to the effort to help this strategic customer built out an SRE function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key part of the problem space was that the monitoring system they used was great for SaaS applications.  And the way the network was being deployed was more SaaS-like.  The whole goal was to build it all out as &amp;ldquo;networking as a service.&amp;rdquo;  But after digging deep with the teams and the technology, we found that there was a huge gap between the low-level networking and how the monitoring system expected to hear alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-details&#34;&gt;Problem Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the system was deployed using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/network-services-orchestrator/index.html&#34;&gt;Cisco Network Service Orchestrator (NS)&lt;/a&gt; and network systems still generate a lot of alerts using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thousandeyes.com/learning/techtorials/snmp-simple-network-management-protocol#:~:text=Simple%20Network%20Management%20Protocol%20(SNMP)%20is%20a%20networking%20protocol%20used,devices%20in%20Internet%20Protocol%20networks.&#34;&gt;SNMP&lt;/a&gt;.  SNMP terminology for an alert is &amp;ldquo;trap.&amp;rdquo;  Most traps are really low level, like &amp;ldquo;signal lost on line card 22&amp;rdquo; type low level.  Generally a modern Network Monitoring System (NMS) collects and aggregates those low level traps into something more actionable.  But this new network was being built in a completely new, modern way, and was not using any existing NMS.  They were cusom modifying a monitoring system used for SaaS instead.  To make things more complicated, there were at least three vendors providing key software for 5G network functionality, all of whom had their own systems that sent varying levels of aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key difference too, if you think about it is that Prometheus is a pull model.  It &amp;ldquo;scrapes&amp;rdquo; data from REST interfaces, and reacts.  The whole SNMP trap model is a &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; model: sending UDP messages to a target destination.  It&amp;rsquo;s sad, but a lot of systems that use SNMP cannot even use FQDN for the target.  The failure model for networking gear assumes the worst, and does not want to rely on getting a DNS reply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This really was a case of impedance mismatch between the networking world and the SaaS world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary-of-the-solution&#34;&gt;Summary of the Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed and wrote a system called the &amp;ldquo;Observability Framework.&amp;rdquo;  That&amp;rsquo;s my fault.  I&amp;rsquo;m not that creative with names.  Internally we gave it a code name of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusanagi_no_Tsurugi&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Kusanagi&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, named after a legendary Japanese sword.  The system was based around Prometheus, running in Kubernetes (k8s).  It accepted inputs as SNMP traps, logs via remote syslog, and metrics using the standard Prometheus scraping mechanism.  Scrapes were easy, and often we&amp;rsquo;d just deploy node exporter with Ansible onto key machines.  Logs went into an Elastic Search cluster, and we ran periodic queries for known issues and then generated alerts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel thing we did was to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/&#34;&gt;Prometheus AlertManager (AM)&lt;/a&gt; as the interface between our software and the SaaS monitoring system.  This gave us aggregation aggregation and muting with a known, testable, documented interface.  Metrics, logs, and SNMP traps would all map to a set of defined &amp;ldquo;alerts&amp;rdquo; delivered to the SaaS monitoring system by AM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a few tricky parts.  One was getting k8s running in an all IPv6 environment.  Another was dealing with the incoming traps.  We pumped them through &lt;a href=&#34;https://net-snmp.sourceforge.io/docs/man/snmptrapd.html&#34;&gt;snmptrapd&lt;/a&gt; and output text that piped through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/beats/&#34;&gt;beats&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/&#34;&gt;Elastic&lt;/a&gt;.  We had to write a little code to do some custom processing of some of the traps because they were weird, but that was a corner case, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big thing to solve was making AlertManager HA.  This was especially critical since we used &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/linki/chaoskube&#34;&gt;chaoskube&lt;/a&gt; to randomly kill pods.  This ensured constant testing that our solution was reliable.  But it also ensured that periodically we had an AM that was completely blind to all the alerts that recently happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alertmanager-ha&#34;&gt;AlertManager HA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things may have changed in the last few years.  That&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ll dig into as I set it all up again.  But for our solution, we discovered that the clustering feature for AM uses a gossip protocol to share alerts.  Any alert showing up at one AM is duplicated at another.  This provides &amp;ldquo;AP&amp;rdquo; coverage, but did not cover &amp;ldquo;C.&amp;rdquo;  If you rebooted an AM, or started a new one, you would not have state.  The new AM would be missing some alerts.  That created a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our duplicate AMs would send alerts to the SaaS Monitoring system, and it was configured to clear alerts/tickets if the system recovered.  There were many automated responces that would get triggered by the ticket, run a script/tailf/something to cause a recovery, and then wait for the condidtion to clear.  In a complex, cascading fault recovery the duplicate AMs and SaaS Monitoring systems might be partitioned.  Since some of these conditions were actual network probles (it was a &amp;ldquo;network as a service&amp;rdquo; afterall) we needed to have at least one AM detect that the problem had been cleared and &amp;ldquo;clear&amp;rdquo; the alert.  We actually needed more consistency.  But CAP theorem says you cannot have all three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we cheated it a bit.  We wrote the code to have AM use &lt;a href=&#34;https://etcd.io/&#34;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt; to store the alert state.  Every AM would put it&amp;rsquo;s state there (if that alert had not already been stored).  Each AM would then periodically sync it&amp;rsquo;s alert state to etcd, and on startup, would pull all alerts into memory.  We submitted a PR for this, but the Prometheus team did not see it as a priority.  It probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t:  it was just something this particular use case needed.  So we had to fork the code, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is open source, published here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cisco-kusanagi/alertmanager-ha&#34;&gt;alertmanager-ha&lt;/a&gt;.  Our talk at SphereIT in Poland in late 2019 includes a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/HHHvX5HloYQ?t=1667&#34;&gt;live, on-stage demo&lt;/a&gt; of this feature in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading over the current AM docs, I suspect that the same gossip sync is still in place.  I&amp;rsquo;ll figure that out in the coming weeks as I set it all up again.  My requirements are certainly not for HA, but I do want reliability.  My monitoring is mostly my local infrastructure at two locations.  I&amp;rsquo;m still on the fence about the pull vs push model for metric collection, as I&amp;rsquo;ve talked about in my posts on MQTT and control in general.  But I am coming around to it.  At the end of the day you have to have a proper inventory of &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; on the network anyway.  You need a means to do service discovery anyway.  So hook into that and poll things.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/&#34;&gt;Prometheus Exporters&lt;/a&gt; are simple and fairly bulletproof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have read this far, you should have an appreciation for the complexities of building something to &amp;ldquo;observe&amp;rdquo; a complex, mult-vender, multi-technology platform.  The CAP theory has very, very real implications on how you design and build systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credit-where-due&#34;&gt;Credit Where Due!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team that did the heavy lifting for all this are among the very top Engineers I have ever known.  Credit to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcwangmit01/&#34;&gt;David Wang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmdots/&#34;&gt;Josh Dotson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiehang/&#34;&gt;Hang Xi&lt;/a&gt;.  Not only did they put up with me, they worked a million hours, never complained (much), and delivered.  More than delilvered.  I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have worked with them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enable Chatbots on the phone using Amazon Lex and the Amazon Chime SDK</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/lex2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2022 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Telephony made a huge leap forward last week.  It&amp;rsquo;s insanely easy to build a voice chatbot for phone calls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week the Amazon Chime SDK team released a whole pile of new features, including native integration with Amazon Polly for text to speach, and Amazon Lex for chatbots.  Gone are the days of &amp;ldquo;press 1 for this, or 2 for that.&amp;rdquo;  You can now just talk to a human sounding voice in many languages.  You can build the bot in the Lex console and test it live.  Then you can connect that to a phone number with literally a few lines of code.  In fact, you don&amp;rsquo;t even need to know how to code!  You can literally just follow the directions in the example code and paste one line into a file, run one command, and then it just works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote an official &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/enable-conversational-chatbots-for-telephony-using-amazon-lex-and-the-amazon-chime-sdk/&#34;&gt;AWS blog called &amp;ldquo;Enable conversational chatbots for telephony using Amazon Lex and the Amazon Chime SDK&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; that spells it all out.  There&amp;rsquo;s a whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-audio-workshop&#34;&gt;GitHub Repository&lt;/a&gt; that lays out a &amp;ldquo;workshop&amp;rdquo; style approach to learning how to use the Amazon Chime SDK, along with fully functional example code that you can use as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-learn-to-do-this&#34;&gt;How Do I learn to do this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not hard at all to do modern, cloud-based telephony development.  You literally just need to know how to write a lambda function.  With just a few hours of play, you can walk through &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-audio-workshop/tree/main/lambdas&#34;&gt;a few examples&lt;/a&gt;.  The code examples were designed to lead you step by step from simple to more complex.  There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-audio-workshop/tree/main/docs/how-it-works&#34;&gt;detailed documentation&lt;/a&gt; on the programming model and some hints and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-audio-workshop/tree/main/docs/tips-and-tricks&#34;&gt;suggestions&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier to develop lambda functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also full deployment automation included, using the Amazon Cloud Development Kit (CDK).  If you follow me at all, you know my policy is &amp;ldquo;start with the deployment automation and then do the design.&amp;rdquo;  The repo even has &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-audio-workshop/tree/main/docs/cdk-overview&#34;&gt;documentation on how the CDK automation is organized&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wait-what--i-can-get-a-real-phone-number&#34;&gt;Wait, what?  I can get a real phone number?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep.  In about 20 countries.  You can rent the phone number.  In the US the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/pricing/&#34;&gt;list price&lt;/a&gt; is #1/month.  It&amp;rsquo;s a real phone number.  And you control it, using software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-i-build&#34;&gt;What can I build?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything that uses a phone call!  And more!  Seriously.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick idea:  want to make your own Google Phone number?  Spiff up the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-audio-workshop/tree/main/lambdas/call-and-bridge&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Call and Bridge&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; demo!  You don&amp;rsquo;t need to prompt for the number to dial, since you know your own number.  Just change it so that Amazon Polly says &amp;ldquo;now connecting to Jane, please wait a moment&amp;rdquo; and then bridge the call to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question really isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;what can I build?&amp;rdquo;  The real question is &amp;ldquo;what can&amp;rsquo;t you build?  And why not built it today?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodbye Ubuntu, Hello Debian my old friend - AGAIN</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/debian-again2/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Back to the future, debian again.  Ubuntu begone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years ago I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/debian-again/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; that whined a bit about how Ubuntu had changed too many things, especially the snap monstrosity.  I think I earned the right to complain since I first installed Linux in 1994 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I went back to Ubuntu.  I wanted dual secondary screens.  Now?  Meh.  Not as important.  But I still had that rig on Ubuntu, mostly because once it was set up it was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I solved the snap thing: I wrote a script that just removed all the snap crap.  But they keep just changing things for no good reason, and then I simply could not find where they configured DNS resolution when it SHOULD be in the standard place.  Somehow it was magically caching DNS settings, and I was moving my DHCP/DNS from my Unifi rig over to a dedicated server (don&amp;rsquo;t ask, I just needed higher granularity of control) and it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I wanted to throw a linux machine into the bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was getting some weird unexplained &amp;ldquo;System Error Reports&amp;rdquo; anyway, and I&amp;rsquo;d just installed Debian on some small computers for testing anyway, so what the hell. In for a penny, in for a pound!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notebook I was installing on is a Dell Inspiron 5000 Gaming PC.  Older.  Crap keyboard.  But it works as a dev box that has a second screen for displaying monitoring graphs.  Wait.  What?  You don&amp;rsquo;t have extra monitors just to show monitoring?  I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I somehow blew up the UEFI config.  Much angste.  I did finally fine a &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/1103170/accidently-deleted-boot-option-on-dell-laptop&#34;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;  that helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For posterior:  if after you install it won&amp;rsquo;t boot, then you blew up the Boot Option config.  Go into the BIOS Config (F2 on boot) and then under &amp;ldquo;Boot Sequence&amp;rdquo; you pick any name you want for the new &amp;ldquo;Boot Option Name&amp;rdquo; (I picked Debian).  Then navigate the &amp;ldquo;File Name&amp;rdquo; to find  /EFI/Debian/grubx64.efi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it gets happy.  I&amp;rsquo;m sure I have to tweak the GPU stuff and manually add the right drivers for WiFi.  That all should be on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Dell&#34;&gt;DebianOn pages&lt;/a&gt; I hope.  I&amp;rsquo;ll keep you appraised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think, DNS configured by /etc/resolv.conf!  The world is right again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DevOps - All Things To All People - or Not?</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/devops-what/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Seems like everyone is clammoring for DevOps folks.  Do they really know what they want?  That term means all things to all people.  Some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-devops&#34;&gt;What is DevOps?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just about six years ago I wrote a blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-devops-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;How To Do DevOps&lt;/a&gt; that is as accurate today as it was then.  Boil it all away and you need to align the interests (and reward structures) of Operations and Development, and you need to treat Operations as if it was a software problem.  Three years ago I blogged about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;Cloudy DevOps&lt;/a&gt; and how it&amp;rsquo;s all a process.  That&amp;rsquo;s still true too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But conversations with a few folks recently have got me thinking more about this.  It&amp;rsquo;s good to get some review, and some basic agreement in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DevOps and CI/CD are answers to a business problem. Consumers expect both web and mobile software for everything. Uber shows you how far away your ride is, live on a map.  FedEx shows you every step of where your package is, and when it will arrive at your doorstep.  Kaiser Permanente shows you test results online the day after giving blood.  Every company, regardless of their product, is becoming a software company.  New features and especially security fixes are expected to occur frequently.  The approaches to building software from even 10 years ago no longer meet the expectations of consumers.  DevOps has arisen as is a collection of tools and processes to reduce the time and cost to create new software and then deploy and operate that software. Continuous Integration (CI) automates the merging of new software code and the associated testing.  Continuous Deployment automates installing and configuring software and software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most folks I hear talking about DevOps are mostly talking about CI/CD.  Which is short-sighted.  But let&amp;rsquo;s run with that for now.  Despite what many vendors convey in their marketing, DevOps is more than just tools.  To accomplish the business goal, it requires a combination of technology, process, and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;technology&#34;&gt;Technology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best technology for DevOps depends on the technology stack in use, but also has implications on the processes and the people involved.  Jenkins has been a mainstream CI tool for years, but is less well suited for newer serverless systems, or for container orchestration systems like Kubernetes (k8s).  k8s has changed the operational posture completely by automating much of traditional “operations.”  This spawned a new set of tools (helm charts for deployments, for example) and new products (Flux, Argo).  Similarly, “observability” has overtaken simple monitoring, with Prometheus leading to Thanos and the OpenTelemetry efforts leading to Honeycomb.  The rate of change in these technologies is significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it.  Only 11 years ago OpenStack was the darling of many Enterprises.  Only 5 years ago VCs were still investing in Mesos/Marathon platform companies.  And in a few years, k8s will be replaced with something newer and better.  Gasp!  Can it be?  Yes, the cutting edge will replace k8s.  More on that below.  The important thing to realize is that all of this changes, faster than you want it to.  As changes continue the “right” CI/CD/DevOps technology will change again. Expertise in these technologies requires not just learning, but actual doing.  The smart Technology Leader will realize that they really need folks with experience migrating between technologies.  Hands-on skills with any one technology have a short half-life.  Understanding of first principles and the ability to learn is what an organization needs.  Beware teams and Engineers who learned it once and want to coast.  This game is the fastest changing game in tech if you account for the scope of knowledge required.  Hardware is easy even though it changes fast, because at least it&amp;rsquo;s limited in scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do think there&amp;rsquo;s plenty of room for new technology here.  Recently I &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/cicd-thoughts/&#34;&gt;blogged about on-prem and cloud CI/CD&lt;/a&gt;.  Having a declarative way to create/define/configure a mixed in-prem and cloud environment, that is immutable like k8s is, seems to be the way to go.  But it feels like we need to let some ML (or just smart defaults) define the hardware.  We should be able to describe our workloads and let smarts figure out what basic hardware deployment is needed.  But I digress.  Some of what those new technologies will need to address are the issues I raise below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;process&#34;&gt;Process&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of DevOps is to reduce the time it takes to obtain the business value from the software. Having a CI/CD solution that can deploy multiple updates per day has limited value if the development team cannot make meaningful changes that often.  Many companies try to become “agile,” but how agile are most teams? Many try and only accomplish “mini-waterfall” delivering new software at the end of two or four week sprints (or worse).  The agile promise is more than that.  True agile allows fixes and improvements to be deployed multiple times per day, perhaps thousands of times per day.  User stories can be accepted and deployed independently and atomically without waiting for some arbitrary “sprint boundary.”  Appropriate automated testing can validate the work in near real-time.  Changes can be deployed and A/B tested in production, widening the deployed footprint automatically, or rolling back changes that indicate a problem.  There are technology tools that enable all of those things, but the development processes - and people - must support that in order to realize those benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you think about DevOps and want modern CI/CD and do multiple releases per day, could you?  Can your process support that?  And track it?  Probably not.  There&amp;rsquo;s a whole pile of process you need to put in place.  And skills, and more tools.  Which leads us to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;people&#34;&gt;People&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processes are performed by people.  Software is written and then deployed/operated by people. Those people need the right skills.  Moving to cloud requires a substantial new set of skills, but serverless, containers, container orchestration, distributed architectures, and consuming managed services have exponentially increased the required skill set for the product development team.  New tools to track the work?  New skills to learn.  And yes, like k8s, those too will change.  In a few years there will be new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even more important than skill-set are the mind-set of the team.  As companies go global and become more dependent on software the expectations on the staff change. DevOps (and especially DevSecOps) merges what used to be disparate, separate skilled teams into a group that collectively become responsible to keep things working and make things better.  “Normal working-hours” white collar knowledge workers from a few years ago are now on-call.  Operations staff are now expected to at least read code, and perhaps even debug it.  People change more slowly than technology.  The expectations, culture and compensation of the team must be managed differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do they?  I strongly believe that DevOps means that the interests of Operations and Development need to be aligned.  There&amp;rsquo;s another way to solve the problem than having developers learn ops and Operators learning development: Google&amp;rsquo;s SRE model.  I won&amp;rsquo;t dig into that now, but the whole field of &amp;ldquo;Resiliency Engineering&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;reliabililty Engineering&amp;rdquo; really boils down to being able to have high feature velocity AND high uptime at the same time.  The SRE approach has two key ideas to it:  a team of Engineers who specialize in these things that acts as an overlay organization, and more importantly, a rock-solid commitment to a &amp;ldquo;budget&amp;rdquo; of reliability.  When you want to make changes and you don&amp;rsquo;t have room in the availability budget, Development teams work instead on creating more budget through debt reduction, better designs/abstractions, ops tools, etc.  There&amp;rsquo;s whole books on this, so I won&amp;rsquo;t go on.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t think you can staff your Dev and Ops teams with folks who can move towards each others skills, you probably need to be thinking about going SRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accomplishing the business goal of delivering software faster and cheaper requires leadership in all three of these areas.  The technology will change much faster than the processes, and the people will change slower still.  Expertise in today’s technology is vital, but it is also critical to plan for the inevitable change in those technologies.  The leadership you seek may be more than a single person or role.  You may need one or more senior technologists fluent in the low-level technologies today, as well as a seasoned leaders who have managed these kinds of transitions before and can look around corners to see the problems of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, DevOps, CI/CD, SRE are all just names for things.  The business goal is to deliver more features in the same amount of time, and &amp;ldquo;always work.&amp;rdquo;  That&amp;rsquo;s what consumers have come to expect, and that&amp;rsquo;s what every business needs to try to deliver.  Don&amp;rsquo;t drown in the alphabet soup.  Keep your mind on the business goal, remember that it&amp;rsquo;s all going to change faster than you want it to, and get the best people you can.  And yes, this flies in the face of what most of your tool vendors are telling you.  My favorite question for them is to have their Engineering Leaders come tell me how they do DevOps.  If it&amp;rsquo;s not better than how you are doing it, what makes them think their tool is all that great?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on CI/CD</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/cicd-thoughts/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/cicd-thoughts/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Yet again I am thinking about the overall software development/deployment life cycle, and am back to thinking about CI/CD again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should be building out a second MQTT server and setting it up as a failover.  I&amp;rsquo;ve written &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/mqtt/&#34;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; about MQTT being a SPOF.  But I am afflicted with the curse of the software developer: laziness.  What I really should do is solve it correctly, forever, with a means to automatically deploy it.  I need it in TWO locations, and if it&amp;rsquo;s useful to me it probably is useful to others, so I should automate it.  But then I get busy in my day job and then I write blog posts and I still have not done it.  Not to mention re-writing some IPTABLES rules so I can more easily see my remote cameras.  But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of that, I have similar problems there.  I&amp;rsquo;m writing a ton of sample code for some cool new things (no leaks here!).  I prefer &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&#34;&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt;.  But both are what I would call &amp;ldquo;first generation&amp;rdquo; IaaS tools.  All they really do is deployment of infrastructure.  A &amp;ldquo;second generation&amp;rdquo; tool would be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/&#34;&gt;Amazon Cloud Development Kit (CDK)&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s new v2 with constructs is quite nice.  It even has some minimal CI capability, especially in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/aws-lambda-nodejs-readme.html&#34;&gt;Amazon Lambda Nodejs Library&lt;/a&gt; where you can bundle your typescript into the lambda.  That&amp;rsquo;s been very helpful, especially as an easier way to use typescript for lambdas.  Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there&amp;rsquo;s a whole pile of example code and blogs coming around that.  Patience, and what a few weeks for a certain trade show&amp;hellip;  I&amp;rsquo;m especially interested in the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cdk_pipeline.html&#34;&gt;CDK Pipelines&lt;/a&gt; that let you build CD pipelines for CDK scripts.  Those move what is a developer tool (&amp;lsquo;cdk init&amp;rsquo;) to something you can really use in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be desired.  All that works for certain kinds of cloud workloads.  But not all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-premise-environments&#34;&gt;On-Premise Environments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDK works for an AWS cloud enviroment, but can&amp;rsquo;t work for my on-prem enviroment.  That&amp;rsquo;s not totally true either:  there is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v1/docs/aws-codedeploy-readme.html&#34;&gt;AWS CodeDeploy Construct Library&lt;/a&gt; that I really should try.  But that won&amp;rsquo;t work easily for my environments since the whole VPN thing is complicated.  Both my ISPs operate on private address space, so doing a VPN to a cloud is complicated.  I&amp;rsquo;ll try to blog about that another time.  Plus, I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to do a cloud-based deployment for stuff that runs totally on-premise.  It&amp;rsquo;s just introducing another dependency.  So CDK isn&amp;rsquo;t especially a good solution for my home problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloud-native&#34;&gt;Cloud Native&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was going to do things &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; for the MQTT problem, I would set up a three node kubernetes cluster and let it do the work for me. I have not tried it, but there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://serverfault.com/questions/1045712/how-to-setup-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;examples of config files&lt;/a&gt; and even a &lt;a href=&#34;https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/k8s-at-home/mosquitto&#34;&gt;helm chart&lt;/a&gt; to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hoo boy, now we dive down the rabbit hole.  How to manage that?  Go all the way to gitops? Not familiar?  GitOps is the operational practice that NOTHING in your deployment is valid if it did not get there through a git checkin, usually of a helm chart.  For the newbies, Linux Foundation has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-gitops-lfs169/&#34;&gt;course&lt;/a&gt; that is probably generic enough.  I spoke this morning to a great Engineer who is now leading a DevOps team at a startup and they are all in on GitOps.  They use &lt;a href=&#34;https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/&#34;&gt;ArgoCD&lt;/a&gt; and their developers love it.  Great GUI.  We went that route at Cisco when I was there too, at least in the group I was last in.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://fluxcd.io/&#34;&gt;Flux&lt;/a&gt; would probably be more my style, since I am a command line person more than a gui person.  Both have come far in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-what-about-cloud-cloud&#34;&gt;But What About Cloud-Cloud?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to my day job and CDK.  It&amp;rsquo;s not kubernetes (k8s for short).  In fact, in all of 2020 as a leader of Solution Architects helping literally thousands of customers, I only saw a few customers using k8s.  My advice for anyone writing new software would definitely be to consider k8s, especially if you have the developers who can embrace it.  But most customers were early in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;cloud journey&lt;/a&gt; and they were buying at least some of their software.  Or, migrating to cloud and at least some of the software was &amp;ldquo;as a service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In those scenarios, the &amp;ldquo;Cloud Native&amp;rdquo; solutions can&amp;rsquo;t help a bit.  And they don&amp;rsquo;t deal with IaaS at all.  That would be a problem for someone wanting to build major communications software using my day job product (the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/&#34;&gt;Amazon Chime SDK&lt;/a&gt;), especially the telephony parts.  The alure of our offering is that you can run a script and create real phone numbers in the cloud that you can then programatically control.  But those are cloud resources, and &amp;ldquo;cloud native&amp;rdquo; tools like ArgoCD/Flux/Helm/whatever can&amp;rsquo;t help at all.  Same thing if you need to create S3 buckets, for example.  The CD tooling can deploy the SOFTWARE, but not the infra.  CDK can do both, but cannot do k8s.  Both have problems if you also want to deploy on-premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, there isn&amp;rsquo;t a good tool that works for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-what-about-cloud-services&#34;&gt;But What About Cloud Services?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, a day job problem.  Under the hood cloud services are web-services (usually but not always REST services).  Software that consumes those services are configured with the &amp;ldquo;production&amp;rdquo; endpoint (URL) and stuff just works. Some new services are in beta (or gamma) and the way those are exposed is through a different &amp;ldquo;endpoint&amp;rdquo; which often is &amp;ldquo;allow-listed&amp;rdquo; somehow to limit who can use it.  This is extremely common in any non-trivial system composed of micro-services.  The difference between &amp;ldquo;environments&amp;rdquo; (alpha, beta, gamma, stage, production, whatever you call it) is often the endpoint you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, a proper CI/CD system would also keep track of the &amp;ldquo;environment&amp;rdquo; and have a way to store the endpoints for different services, so that it could be discovered by software.  There&amp;rsquo;s software that enables this.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.consul.io/&#34;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://zookeeper.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Zookeeper&lt;/a&gt; come to mind.  K8s uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://etcd.io/&#34;&gt;etcd&lt;/a&gt; for this.  So what, now I have to roll that out too, in order to do a proper staged pipeline of CD?  Hmmm. Lots of extra work there, and for darn sure not something I would do in a small on-premise network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, the tools don&amp;rsquo;t support this key need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;counter-arguments-and-answers-which-may-be-just-more-questions&#34;&gt;Counter-Arguments, and Answers (which may be just more questions)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Traditionalist Cloud Practitioners&amp;rdquo; (ha, have we done cloud long enough for those folks to really exist yet?) would argue that except for small companies you need &amp;ldquo;separation of concerns&amp;rdquo; and that the Infra team needs to be different than the software team, blah blah blah.  Sure.  The skill sets are different.  But if the software developers are not intimately familiar with the infra they need, and more importantly the security limitations (&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html&#34;&gt;IAM rules, in AWS speak&lt;/a&gt;) there&amp;rsquo;s a natural gap that leads to friction and mis-understandings.  If not during development, definitely during an incident.  The infra folks need to understand what the software is doing too, for the same reasons.  Bosses should care deeply, since the ability to increase your feature velocity is directly connected to the most important (for speed) &amp;ldquo;ility&amp;rdquo; there is:  disposability.  I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/disposability/&#34;&gt;written about that before&lt;/a&gt;.  So you see, the whole idea that we can use CI for the developers and CD for the Infra/Ops team is nonsense, if you want to go fast, test better, and increase your confidence in reliability.  They need to work together.  In fact, they need three things to be &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; in my opinion.  Read about that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-devops-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jenkins.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins?&lt;/a&gt;  Well, it&amp;rsquo;s getting old in the tooth.  How are you going to deploy jenkins itself?  And it&amp;rsquo;s just CI.  It does not touch CD, let alone IaaS deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34;&gt;Terraform!&lt;/a&gt;  Yes.  Aside from the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s own language, it is amazing.  It does IaaS deployment very well.  But it can&amp;rsquo;t touch the other parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-implications-on-agile-software-development&#34;&gt;Practical Implications on Agile Software Development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building software is hard.  Operating software is harder.  Doing it well is harder still.  Doing it at scale is herculean.  Adopting agile methods has proven to help though.  But that&amp;rsquo;s a process on how humans work.  I especially admire the ebook &lt;a href=&#34;https://codefresh.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GitOps-2.0-The-Future-of-DevOps-Ebook-v4.pdf&#34;&gt;GitOps 2.0&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://codefresh.io/&#34;&gt;CodeFresh&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve not yet looked at their product but in the book they eloquently talk about the need for &amp;ldquo;feature observability.&amp;rdquo;   In a practical software shop management will ask &amp;ldquo;how long will it take to add feature X?&amp;rdquo;  Agile can answer that, usually.  But there&amp;rsquo;s a lack of tooling to answer &amp;ldquo;which code release has feature X in it?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;at which stage in our pipeline is feature X?&amp;rdquo;  This is because features tracked in the agile tools are not tagged to actual CI builds, and CI build tags are not visible in tools that show what&amp;rsquo;s in various pipeline/environment stages.  I see this in my day job all the time - and at every shop I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of.  Remember, &amp;ldquo;done done&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;in production, doing real things for real customers.&amp;rdquo;  Anything short of that the feature is not done.  But the developers THINK it&amp;rsquo;s done, since it passed their tests and the first stage of your pipeline.  Tracking that last bit is a gap most shops don&amp;rsquo;t have a good solution for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-the-answer&#34;&gt;So What Is the Answer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet.  And it&amp;rsquo;s stalling me, since I really should get my home MQTTs to be redundant, and I can&amp;rsquo;t stomach doing it with IP-address takeover and configuring my Ubuntu boxes manually.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending so much of my time on CDK, as well as learning how to develop services in typescript.  My instinct is that ultimate answer will be writtin in go, but that might just be wishful thinking.  Here are some things that I wish I had in such a tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;works on premise and in cloud (best: able to support multi-cloud)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports containers, because that&amp;rsquo;s how software should be packaged these days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports k8s as an option, not as a requirement - should support running with systemd for isolated services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;has a secrets and configuration store that can be auto-discovered (suitable for on-prem or cloud)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optionally can plug into monitoring sytems, or at least alerting systems, for deployment failures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wishful thinking still, I guess.  There is no CI/CD ring to rule them all.  But if you know of tools I should be aware of, drop me a note.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/gherlein&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gherlein/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, or old fashioned email at gherlein &lt;at&gt; herlein.com.  No spam please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since the perfect is the enemy of the good enough to ship, I suspect I just need to do a 3 node k8s cluster and a helm chart and be done with the MQTT problem.  We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long that takes me to get to!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating an Ephemeral EC2 Instance for Development for Testing</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/single-ec2-cdk/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cattle, not Pets!&amp;rdquo; they say.  Except that for a lot of development, coders make their own laptop their favorite pet.  &amp;ldquo;It works on my machine!&amp;rdquo; becomes normal.  I got tired of that and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/single-ec2-cdk&#34;&gt;automated the creation of my dev environment.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my day job I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing reference code and blogs a lot lately.  I&amp;rsquo;m writing stuff to help people learn how to use the Amazon Chime SDK to build modern communications software.  Any modern software has a lot of dependencies, usually in the form of things that need to be installed.  I want to make sure that the code works on a new system and not just on mine.  To do this, I test out my code and all the steps in my blog on a clean, fresh cloud server.  Amazon EC2 instances are perfect for this, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of &amp;ldquo;undifferentiated heavy lifting&amp;rdquo; (ok, more like a long list of annoying admin tasks) to make a new instance actually usable.  Doing that every time is a waste of time and finally got on my nerves.  So I automated it.  For the impatient, just head on over to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/single-ec2-cdk&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; and check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;posted before&lt;/a&gt; about how important all the &amp;ldquo;ilities&amp;rdquo; are, and that the essence of cloud is DISPOSABILITY.  &amp;ldquo;Cattle, not pets&amp;rdquo; as they say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;aws-cloud-development-kit-cdk&#34;&gt;AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/&#34;&gt;AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)&lt;/a&gt; instead of using &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&#34;&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt;.  With the CDK I can write real code, using a mainstream language.  CloudFormation (CF) is just writing what you want into a config file, and Terraform (TF) has some more programmability but is it&amp;rsquo;s own proprietary language.  With the CDK I can write in a real language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing all that special about the EC2 part.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/single-ec2-cdk/blob/main/lib/single-ec2-stack.ts&#34;&gt;CDK script &lt;/a&gt; reads a config file, spins up a VPC, configures the security group and creates an EC2 instance.  It then sets the host name in DNS (if you added a zone ID for Route53 in the config file).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-magic-is-in-the-user-data&#34;&gt;The Magic is in the User Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup all happens when the new EC2 runs the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/single-ec2-cdk/blob/main/userdata/user_script.sh&#34;&gt;user data script&lt;/a&gt;.  This installs a pile of software routinely used for AWS development.  Optionally, if you add another script of your own (pointed at in the config file, described &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/single-ec2-cdk/blob/main/userdata/user_script.sh&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) you can add your own username and personal configuration.  For example, I always set up a new linux box with my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/gch&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;gch&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; folder where I install my preferred tools and configure them.  If you were going to use that you&amp;rsquo;d need to change usernames and settings to suit yourself.  It&amp;rsquo;s useful as an example though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are developing for the cloud, you should probably embrace it all the way.  That means that you should be able to re-create a functional development environment on demand, toss it out, and get a new one in moments.  That&amp;rsquo;s what cloud is all about.  That&amp;rsquo;s why I build this automation.  I hope you find it useful!  Pull Requests welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Learnings from patching a bug in a modern project</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/modern-node-dev/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/modern-node-dev/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to dive deep on modern typescript/node development.  I fixed a bug in a
new tool I am using (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/projen/projen/pull/1437&#34;&gt;projen&lt;/a&gt;) and learned
a ton along the way.  This post is to share some of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have followed me lately you know that I am developing code for telephony again (and loving it!  Want to work in my group?  We&amp;rsquo;re &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/search?base_query=chime+sdk&amp;loc_query=&#34;&gt;hiring!&lt;/a&gt;.  A big part of this is developing the deployment automation that goes with the application - the &amp;ldquo;infrastructure as code&amp;rdquo; part of the solution.  I am all-in with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/&#34;&gt;Amazon Cloud Development Kit (CDK)&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;rsquo;m very excited about a new book that just
came out, appropriately titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://thecdkbook.com/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The CDK Book&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are serious
about using the CDK stop reading this and go buy it.  Seriously.  You need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thecdkbook.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cdkbook-cover.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I especially like the section on levels of abstraction using &amp;ldquo;constructs.&amp;rdquo;  That&amp;rsquo;s a post for another day.  The book describes how to easily build and publish a CDK construct as an npm module.  The authors of the tool don&amp;rsquo;t believe in templates (yikes!) and prefer a tool to build a templated repo for you.  That&amp;rsquo;s where Projen comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/projen/projen&#34;&gt;Projen&lt;/a&gt; aims to &amp;ldquo;define and maintain complex project configuration through code.&amp;rdquo;  I believe the same thing about Infra and Operations, so I&amp;rsquo;m all in. I have to know more.  I immediately did the &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it immediately blew up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;gherlein@ip-172-31-61-56:~/t$ npx projen new awscdk-construct

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; t@0.0.0 eslint
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;gt; npx projen eslint
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Error: Command failed: git init -b main
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;error: unknown switch &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;b&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dug around a bit and verified that yes, it wants to do &amp;ldquo;init -b main&amp;rdquo; to set the default
branch to main (not master).  The right thing to do.  More digging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that git only added &amp;ldquo;init -b&amp;rdquo; as an option in version 2.28.  I was working on an
EC2 instance running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.  Behold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gherlein@ip-172-31-61-56:~/t$ git --version
git version 2.25.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is quickly fixable, of course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt remove -y git git-man
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt -y update
sudo apt -y install git
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;But my new role is in my DNA now, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want other folks to have this friction.  They at least need to know that it&amp;rsquo;s a known issue that they should upgrade.  So I sent a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/projen/projen/pull/1424&#34;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; to edit the README.  Very, very quickly I had a reply from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Chriscbr&#34;&gt;@Chriscbr&lt;/a&gt; suggesting we revert to the older way of doing the git commands that accomplishes the same thing.  Then &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/eladb&#34;&gt;@eladb&lt;/a&gt;  quickly commented that maybe we should check the version and then do the right thing.  Good call and Kudos to Elad and Christopher for being right on top of new issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which now brings us to the point of my blog post.  Find it, try to fix it, right?  Plus, I really need to understand how larger, more complicated node projects are organized and what the workflow is to develop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projen has an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/projen/projen/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md&#34;&gt;excellent page on contributing&lt;/a&gt;.  I often don&amp;rsquo;t read those pages because they are T&amp;amp;Cs about licensing.  In this case, it&amp;rsquo;s an excellent primer on how to go about setting up a development environment.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the neat trick I learned extrapolated to any similar &amp;ldquo;tool&amp;rdquo; you will run with npx:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, in your tool directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd /path/to/local/tool/repo
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yarn link
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in the folder you plan to work from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd /path/to/working folder
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yarn link &amp;lt;tool name&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;node_modules/projen/bin/&amp;lt;tool name&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The command &lt;a href=&#34;https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;yarn link&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; creates a symlink at the global node_modules level.  You can then directly run your tool from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practicality-of-approach&#34;&gt;Practicality of Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projen example is a perfect way to build system-level tools using typescript.  It seems pretty easy to make shell aliases to npx commands, and you can even &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/ipreda/run-your-npx-script-directly-from-github-create-your-own-cli-commands-and-other-stories-4pn3&#34;&gt;run them directly from github without an install.&lt;/a&gt;.  I can totally see building some tools to help me automate some of the silly things I seem to need to do on new machines.  And I get new machines all the time.  You should too.  You are creating and destroying new EC2 when you need to do a quick test right? Having really easy automation makes it pointless to keep a dev server laying around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thoughts-on-projen&#34;&gt;Thoughts on Projen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;m a believer now. I had looked around for some templates that could be a good starting point for development.  I love how &amp;ldquo;cdk init&amp;rdquo; just works and projen give me that for many more project types.  At least until something shows me otherwise I now fully support the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TemplatesAreEvil&#34;&gt;#TemplatesAreEvil movement!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps-for-me&#34;&gt;Next Steps for Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a logical extension of this will be to create projects at a higher abstraction level.  The [CDK book] talks about Level 3 constructs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, maybe you’ve adopted AWS Serverless and want to build all your APIs using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. You could create a construct called MySimpleApi that creates a new API Gateway, Lambda Function, and DynamoDB Table L2 constructs according to your own specific architectural needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, a L3 construct &amp;ldquo;MySimpleApi&amp;rdquo; is the atomic unit of operation and below it are hidden all the implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What if we could take something like projen, add some stock code and a configuration file and &amp;ldquo;synthesize&amp;rdquo; a fully working application?  In the example above, if you add in all the HTML and code for the website you can get MySimpleWebSite and it&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;one click install&amp;rdquo; (only no clicks, since I&amp;rsquo;m a command line kind of guy).  I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of progress to be made around this area and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to learn more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;shout-outs&#34;&gt;Shout Outs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key contributors to projen and cdk - super helpful guys who were immediately responsive:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas Eve!  Playing with the Beaglebone sends me into another thought spiral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend my order for a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/DEV-12774/1568-1261-ND/5762411?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=oce&amp;utm_campaign=4251_OCE21RT&amp;utm_content=productdetail_US&amp;utm_cid=2390020&amp;so=73308949&amp;mkt_tok=MDI4LVNYSy01MDcAAAGBWRx4Gats4svytyH9rzCX8MkWRLTj6I0xtCBa7zYt_ZWugxoNVAh-Ph3226TlLVsbsFHwNkHJqHcRWxYqxDglq_yfWtJYwVmANYjZ_Xyf&#34;&gt;Beaglebone cape proto board&lt;/a&gt; and more &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M1PM55K/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;DS18B20 temperature sensors&lt;/a&gt; arrived and I soldered up connectors on the board.  This is a continuation of my pool sensor work (other posts &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/beaglebone-getting-started/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/tasmota/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  I had a Beaglebone in my parts
drawer left over from an old project.  Good thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t need to buy one.  The supply chain fiasco has driven their price WAY up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/beaglebone.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The green USB adapter with a read LED is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CPI0JQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;Gearmo RS-422/RS-485 Adapter&lt;/a&gt; that will let me communicate with
my pool pump.  Some folks have &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M0KMfXfvbszKeqzu6MUF_7yM6KDHk8cZ5nrH1_OUcAc/edit&#34;&gt;reverse engineered their protocol&lt;/a&gt; but since I am not going to use python I won&amp;rsquo;t be using thier code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the salt air and tropical temperatures play hell with electronics I am putting all of it into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N4FSKZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;waterproof cabinet&lt;/a&gt;.
Early tests with the Netgear GS108E switch, Beaglebone, adapters and all don&amp;rsquo;t really produce much heat.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I will need active cooling.  Remember that part of why I went towards to the Beaglebone was because
it has a much higher allowed temperature range than the Raspberry Pi.  And having a wired ethernet connection can&amp;rsquo;t be beat to remove one potential failure point (WiFi).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essential goal of the project is to be able to read the pool temperature and periodically turn on the pumps and open a control valve that lets the hot water from the solar pool heater flush into the
pool, the close the valve and let the solar heater refill, then turn off the pump.  It&amp;rsquo;s not a diffucult control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-code-worries&#34;&gt;Some Code Worries&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;m doing a lot of typescript and node development at my day job I started down that path.  Wow.  The Beablebone is pretty slow, really.  Node is single threaded, and I can&amp;rsquo;t say it&amp;rsquo;s all that
performant.  Doing some development on the board was painfully slow.  And since I&amp;rsquo;m readying from devices, it&amp;rsquo;s not something I can do on another linux box and move it over.  And it&amp;rsquo;s so slow as I am developing that
I&amp;rsquo;m really wondering if I&amp;rsquo;ll be jumping into debug hell if I use use node for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;rsquo;s a self-respecting geek to do?  Go back to one&amp;rsquo;s roots.  I pulled &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/ser&#34;&gt;some very old C code&lt;/a&gt; I had for doing serial and played around with it and two of the RS-485
adapters.  No problem.  Tested that they worked with &amp;ldquo;screen&amp;rdquo; and then with code and that&amp;rsquo;s a happy path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reading-the-temperature-sensors&#34;&gt;Reading The Temperature Sensors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://klaus.ede.hih.au.dk/index.php/BBB_and_OneWire&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is an excellent tutorial on how to get started reading the sensors.  One or two sensors works great.  But it&amp;rsquo;s REALLY unreliable if I use more
than two.  Check this out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo ls /sys/bus/w1/devices
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;28-00000002864c  28-00000002c80d  28-00000003a931  28-000004d04033  w1_bus_master1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four devices.  Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;beaglebone:~&amp;gt; sudo cat /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000002864c/w1_slave
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff : crc&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;c9 NO
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;00&lt;/span&gt; t&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;-62
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000002864c
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ls: cannot access &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-00000002864c&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;: No such file or directory
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sudo ls /sys/bus/w1/devices/
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;28-00000002c80d  28-000000038289  28-000004d04033  w1_bus_master1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not good.  The device I just read from is no longer present.  Nothing in syslog about it either.  And it gets worse.  Rebooting will sometimes then show one, or two devices.  Reboot again and you
may get three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line:  something is not right.  If I am going down this path I need to plan on spending some time troubleshooting.  I think the most common use case is one or two devices.  I&amp;rsquo;m using four.  That puts me several sigmas from the norm
and lands me square in the land of experimentation again. Sigh.  I could go towards an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pstolarz/w1-gpio-cl&#34;&gt;alternate 1-wire driver&lt;/a&gt; but now I&amp;rsquo;m in driver land on an ARM board.  I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; do that, but then I&amp;rsquo;m back down
a rabbit hole of complexity again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;complexity&#34;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit why I wanted to go down the embedded linux path:  reducing complexity.  I spent a lot of time with the ESP32 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/freertos-helper-esp32/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and
got myself into a place where the complexity of that path seemed larger than I wanted to deal with.  Heading into embedded linux could let me potentially go faster by leveraging higher level languages and code libraries that
would reduce my effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe not.  I&amp;rsquo;m a little pissed off at the moment.  The abstractions that I hoped would help me go faster come at a price.  On an ESP32 I can figure out what is happening pretty fast.  I at least have my Oscope and the code is a single driver.
The cognitive load required to understand the technology and find the problem is something tolerable.  But with the Beaglebone I have the device overlay subsystem, the sysfs interface, then the 1Wire Driver, then the actual temperature driver.
All of which is new to me.  Suddenly the time to market gains I got from being able to set up an embedded system the same way I am accustomed to are gone, vanished into an unknown number of hours of troubleshooting.  It almost feels like
it did back in the day to get sound working on Linux.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-good-stuff-i-found&#34;&gt;Other Good Stuff I Found&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled on several active AWS C development efforts:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-iot&#34;&gt;IoT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-common&#34;&gt;a common lib&lt;/a&gt;.  This rekindled my system thinking of &amp;ldquo;how to I take this past just my local
network later.&amp;rdquo;  I still cringe that maybe AWS Greengrass v2 is not really ready for prime time, but it has been size months since I looked at it.  It gets me thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequent readers will also recall that I have had &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/mqtt/&#34;&gt;some pains with MQTT&lt;/a&gt;, specifically with it being a single point of failure.  But I came across &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.servers.com/support/knowledge/linux-administration/how-to-setup-floating-ip-using-keepalived&#34;&gt;keepalived&lt;/a&gt; that can easily take over an IP address if the other fails.  Using an IP address outside my DHCP range I could easily set this up using linux IP alias.  I can see a path to an easy active-active solution
for the MQTT broker, and I bet the system could tolerate the loss of a few message during failover.  It&amp;rsquo;s worth looking at, especially since EVERYTHING is moving in the direction of MQTT.  Sure, I can hand code up a broadcast UDP solution but back to the &amp;ldquo;how to I expand
this off my local network&amp;rdquo; problem&amp;hellip;  the universe is going MQTT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-some-time-away&#34;&gt;Taking Some Time Away&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holiday breaks - especially the early morning hours - are usually when I actually have time for my own projects.  But I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to set this aside and let my subconscious chew on it awhile.  I went to an embedded linux board to be able to use
higher-level languages like typescript, abstraction libraries that could make me go faster.  And I found myself coming back to C.  And now the advantages I thought I had in using the standard linux GPIO device layer is not an advantage but a potential
huge time sink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should I just go back to an ESP32 and FreeRTOS?  There&amp;rsquo;s a learning curve either way.  I feel like I am in a spiral of decision making.  So it&amp;rsquo;s time to reflect a bit rather than chasing a rabbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;holidays&#34;&gt;Holidays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have sourdough rising in the kitchen, with plans to bake it fresh tomorrow morning.  The sky is clear today after days of steady rain.  Both my kids are home from college.  It&amp;rsquo;s Christmas Eve.  Life is good, and temperature probes and RS-485 is not the most important thing
at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you all a wonderful holiday season, and prosperity, health, and joy in the new year.  We all deserve it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thirty Years Ago Today</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago today I left the US Navy.  A reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thirty-years&#34;&gt;Thirty Years?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the Navy thirty years ago today.  Things were crazy.  My submarine was still undergoing a &amp;ldquo;Restricted Availability&amp;rdquo; (a form of mini-overhaul) and my command was in flux.  They needed to get the sub fixed and go do that they did.  The Cold War
was coming to a close but the tension was persitent, and real.  If you did not serve forward deployed in the Cold War you cannot understand.  You can emphathize, maybe.  But folks, you have no idea.  Forward deployed submarines in the Cold War were basically at war. You just never knew.  It was not a game.  It was deadly serious.  And the Soviet Union was the adversary. Their fall into being just Russia didn&amp;rsquo;t change a thing.  If anything, with Putin it&amp;rsquo;s worse now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is probably a bigger threat today.  But don&amp;rsquo;t kid yourself.  Russia is still a player, as we see with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/world/europe/putin-russia-ukraine-troops.html&#34;&gt;troop buildup on the Ukraine border&lt;/a&gt;.  The game is not over.  War is a continuation of
politcs by other means, but apparently Clauswitz &lt;a href=&#34;https://thediplomat.com/2014/11/everything-you-know-about-clausewitz-is-wrong/&#34;&gt;never actually said that&lt;/a&gt;.  If you think that either China or Russia are not ready to take military action to futher their ambitions please call me.  I have a few bridges to sell you.  Oh, and the US is just as willing.  In case you wonder.  It&amp;rsquo;s the reality of geopolitics.  But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/greg-ribbons.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I served for six years.  My first two were filled with intense, advanced training in electronics and nuclear science.  The last four was onboard the nuclear submarine USS Richard B. Russell (SSN-687).  I am most proud of earning my Dolphins, the &amp;ldquo;special warfare insignia&amp;rdquo; that denotes qualification in submarines.  After that I value the Presidential Unit Citation and an Expeditionary Medal.  That certificate is pretty vague about what we did to earn it.  We don&amp;rsquo;t discuss submarine operations, you see.  I qualified everything a Nuc could in my rate, all the way to Engineering Watch Supervisor.  Yes, I supervised a whole nuclear power plant once upon a time. NASA famously says &amp;ldquo;failure is not an option.&amp;rdquo;  I can relate. We did stuff that was enough to have the President acknowledge our actions.  Stuff that you can&amp;rsquo;t just lose power while you are doing it.  It seared in my soul what &amp;ldquo;good operational practice&amp;rdquo; means.  For a kid in my 20s that was heady stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a love-hate relationship with the Navy, but in reality it made me who I am.  I would definitely not be as successful as I have been had I not had that experience.  Had I not been tossed into the pressure cooker of the Nuclear Power Program.  Had I not had the fantastic mentors and leaders that played such a core part of shaping my views on leadership and commitment.  People like CMDR Giambastiani and CMDR Munns, my two COs.  But mostly it was the Navy Chiefs who made me who I am.  Men like MMCS(SS) Miller, ETCM(SS) Dahler, MMCM(SS) Dix, MMCM(SS) Shupe, ETCM(SS) Ashton.  The truest thing ever said is that the core of the Navy is it&amp;rsquo;s Chiefs.  In another universe I&amp;rsquo;d like to believe I&amp;rsquo;d have joined that fraternity.  But I left the Navy instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years ago today I stepped away from the closest brotherhood I have ever known.  I miss it.  But I&amp;rsquo;m more glad that I left it.  The life that unfolded for me since then has been spectacular.  A wonderful wife.  Two amazing kids.  A great career.  I never hit the tech
jackpot but I hit the life jackpot.  I have no regrets.  I have a wonderful life, and more career and financial success than I ever dreamed of on that cold Chicago night 36 years ago when I went off to boot camp.  And I owe a huge part of it to the values instilled in me by the US Navy Submarine Force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bravo Zulu US Navy.  And fair winds and following seas to the many thousands of sailors out there right now serving.  A special prayer for my bubblehead brothers (and sisters!) who never leave a war footing.  Even if the enemy is not trying to sink you the ocean always is.  Thirty years is a long time.  Things must have radically changed.  But being a submariner never really changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My First Amazon Blog... ML/AI Chatbot over the Phone!</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/amazon-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/amazon-blog/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A month ago I told you I &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/webrtc-phone/&#34;&gt;changed roles&lt;/a&gt; at AWS.  Now I can show you what I&amp;rsquo;ve done since then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a new role at AWS on November 1.  I joined the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/&#34;&gt;Amazon Chime SDK&lt;/a&gt; team to form their Developer Advocacy/Technical Evangalism function.  My job will be to help folks learn how to best use this amazing AWS service to revolutionize their communications.  But what, exactly?  Glad you asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/business-productivity/building-a-pstn-call-answering-system-with-the-amazon-chime-sdk-amazon-lex-and-amazon-polly/&#34;&gt;first official AWS blog posted last Monday&lt;/a&gt;, in sync with re:Invent.  Yes, I was there - more on that later.&lt;br&gt;
I am really proud of this blog, and even more proud of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-lex-pstn-demo&#34;&gt;code we open sourced that goes with it.&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it?  Machine Learning, baby!  Well, kinda.  The result of machine learning.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/lex/&#34;&gt;Amazon Lex&lt;/a&gt; lets you build chatbots with conversational AI.  My code lets you do that conversation over the phone!  Think about that for a moment.  You can sit down today and play with a demo that talks to you over the phone.  How cool is that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this is not about ML/AI Chatbots.  Go check out my &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/business-productivity/building-a-pstn-call-answering-system-with-the-amazon-chime-sdk-amazon-lex-and-amazon-polly/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; for that!  Please!  And tell your friends! Share it around on social media!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of this here today is about cloud telephony.  It&amp;rsquo;s the foundation that I bolted Lex/Polly on top of.  And it&amp;rsquo;s going to change the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-wait-theres-more&#34;&gt;But Wait, There&amp;rsquo;s More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me at all then you know I&amp;rsquo;m all about automation.  &amp;ldquo;Start with Deployment Automation and the software design falls out.&amp;rdquo;  Apparently I said that years ago and someone repeated it back to me recently.  That is indeed my philosophy.  So it won&amp;rsquo;t surprise
you that&amp;rsquo;s where I started with the Chime SDK.  I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to really dig into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/&#34;&gt;AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)&lt;/a&gt; anyway and so I did.  But that&amp;rsquo;s where I ran into my first block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Chime SDK is new enough that native Cloud Formation support is not done yet.  So I did what any self-respecting geek with an automation bent would do:  I created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-cfn-customresource.html&#34;&gt;CloudFormation Custom Resource Provider&lt;/a&gt; - called a Custom Resource Provider (CRP) - for the resources needed for the demo.  In native typescript.  And open sourced it.  You can find it &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-provider&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/baby.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;this-is-in-its-infancy---its-still-a-work-in-progress&#34;&gt;This is in it&amp;rsquo;s Infancy - It&amp;rsquo;s Still a Work-in-Progress&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s early days.  The tool only creates one phone number, one SIP rule, and one SIP Media Appliance (SMA) today.  It&amp;rsquo;s perfect for a demo.  It lets you create the resources you need and more importantly when you are done it lets you delete them with a simple &amp;ldquo;cdk destroy&amp;rdquo; command.  This is the power of the cloud folks:  ephemeral resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hold right there and think about that again.  Use this code and you create a phone number.  A real number you can dial with your phone and interact with.  And when you are done you type a command it all vanishes.  And you paid for only what you used, while you used it.
That&amp;rsquo;s the essence of what I call &amp;ldquo;Cloud 1.0&amp;rdquo; thinking.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;Disposability&lt;/a&gt; is key to even starting to get the benefits of the Cloud.  And we&amp;rsquo;ve now brought this to telephony!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/disposal-automation.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For real production systems you don&amp;rsquo;t want your phone number to vanish back into a pool.  You want to keep it.  The provider code will have to evolve to support &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-cloudformation.NestedStack.html&#34;&gt;nested stacks&lt;/a&gt; or more.  Folks will need the ability to create and update a whole telephony stack and just &amp;ldquo;release&amp;rdquo; the phone numbers from connection to code and keep them allocated.  This logic will all need to be added to the CRP code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is where you can come in.  This code is open source, licensed under the business-friendly MIT-0 license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull Requests welcome!  Come play!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yes--terribly-low-level-though--what-can-i-build-today&#34;&gt;Yes.  Terribly Low-Level Though.  What Can I Build TODAY?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know me at all, you also know that&amp;rsquo;s what I knew you would ask.  Building a cool demo that talks to you and building a cool CRP to help you automate deployment were necessary, but not sufficient.  Not for me, and it should not be for you either.  So I built a template starting point that uses the CRP and does the most basic telephony thing possible:  answer the phone and tell you the time.  Old farts like me will remember that this was always the phone number &amp;ldquo;555-1212.&amp;rdquo;  My example goes a little farther and reads your
caller-id and knows if you have called before.  It stores your number in DynamoDB.  If you are a new caller, it speaks your number back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all open sourced.  You can clone the repos, set up your AWS account and try it all yourself.  And better yet, you can start from there and derive like crazy to make your OWN telephony application.  And if you do, drop me a note so I can help you share it around!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-you-are-even-more-impatient--call-it-now&#34;&gt;If You Are Even More Impatient:  Call it NOW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right!  Call the US number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+1-505-273-6307&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now.  DISCLAIMER:  it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to understand if that will cost you money.  Many plans in the US have no charge for long-distance calls, but if this costs you money it&amp;rsquo;s on you.  The number was allocated from New Mexico USA, so it may well be long-distance for you.  Please be wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/impatient.jpg&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously.  Don&amp;rsquo;t wait.  Call it up.  I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that deployed until folks stop calling it.  Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll leave it up forever.  After all it&amp;rsquo;s cloud cheap!  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/pricing/&#34;&gt;pricing&lt;/a&gt; is currently $1/month for the phone number and $0.002 per minute for the call, plus a tiny cost for the lambda function and DynamoDB consumption.  You could build a pretty powerful application for tens of dollars a year.  Cloud economics at work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;yes-but-how-would-i-really-do-this&#34;&gt;Yes, But How Would I Really Do This?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s simple.  Just replicate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-cdk&#34;&gt;template repo&lt;/a&gt; into your AWS account.  You can see the new Github repo &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/simpleTest&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Clone the CRP as described in the README.  Make sure you have a dependencies intalled like the README describes and then go into the template folder and typled &amp;ldquo;make deploy.&amp;rdquo;  Here is the sum total of what I did after I clicked &amp;ldquo;Use this Template&amp;rdquo; in github into my own &amp;ldquo;simpleTest&amp;rdquo; repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone git@github.com:aws-samples/amazon-chime-sdk-pstn-provider.git
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone git@github.com:gherlein/simpleTest.git
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd simpleTest
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;make deploy
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a few minutes to deploy and I called the phone number it spit out in the output.  It&amp;rsquo;s that easy to deploy.  &lt;strong&gt;How&amp;rsquo;s that for deployment automation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;easter-egg-bug-reward&#34;&gt;Easter Egg Bug Reward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left something &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; in the implementation.  Something simple, but obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/easter-egg-bug.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can tell just by calling the number.  Here&amp;rsquo;s my challenge:  figure it out, and send me a Pull Request to fix it.  There&amp;rsquo;s a reward involved, and not just the fame of contributing to such a ground breaking new technology!  Don&amp;rsquo;t hold your breath though.  I&amp;rsquo;m not rich.  But you will like the reward!  And it will be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are at the begining of a new age of communication.  The phone system is still a core bedrock for most folks, but the Internet is a river of change.  The Amazon Chime SDK melds those two worlds - in a very cloudy way.  Ask yourself:  what kind of things can you build with this?  What simple customer interactions could you automate?  I personally think there&amp;rsquo;s a huge cottage industry for custom software that helps small businesses automate how they interact with customers.  If you are a builder, you might want to get it on this.  It feels a lot like the early days of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m revisiting why I don&amp;rsquo;t like MQTT, and what I am doing about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote in June about &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/mqtt/&#34;&gt;my thoughts on MQTT&lt;/a&gt;.  I had another case where my MQTT broker went down.  The Ubuntu host it was running on did some
stupid Cannonical auto-update and it basically hung with no working network.  Different control system than before though.  In June it was bug zappers that were not getting
controlled.  This time it was outside lights.  Hello Darkness, my old friend.  As in I could not see in my own backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not that big a deal, really.  Quick fix.  But it flared all my design instincts and I wanted to throw things again.  Single Point of Failure (SPoF).  My whole
reliabillity posture is sitting on the uptime of a single host.  My network is pretty solid (Ubiquity gear).  And I have more than one AP to cover, powered by separate
PoE switches.  My network is redundant.  The host running my MQTT broker is my weakest link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/spof.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supposedly there is a commercial broker that has a failover option.  So what.  I&amp;rsquo;m not paying for for proprietary software to solve this.  Besides, I am increasingly
convinced that MQTT is simply not the answer.  What does it give us?  Decoupling, and one to many.  The sender can post a message and then (if retain messages is configured)
you can have many readers get that message.  For sensor data readers may take immediate action or shuttle that data off to an indexed data store.  For command messages
the device reads the command and acts.  The sender and readers are not directly coupled (e.g. HTTP interaction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-better-solution&#34;&gt;A Better Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can get the decoupling in a far easier way.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with this idea for a long time and now is the time to really build it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcast UDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your reaction to reading was almost certainly negative.  Oh, it&amp;rsquo;s unreliable.  Oh, you have to do extra work.  Bah.  Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantage--lightweight-low-impact&#34;&gt;Advantage:  Lightweight, Low Impact&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending a broadcast UDP packet is lightweight.  The network itself becomes your broker.  Yes, because the packets are broadcast every node on the subnet
has to process it.  Even if I send one reading per SECOND it&amp;rsquo;s really no traffic at all.  Let&amp;rsquo;s say I have 50 devices (I don&amp;rsquo;t).  50 packets per second at 1K payload each is
basically nothing.  On my network I have a VLAN set up just for my IoT devices, so sending a broadcast message actually has an even smaller impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have been reading my blog, you know that I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of playing around with ESP8266 and &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/freertos-helper-esp32/&#34;&gt;ESP32&lt;/a&gt; these past few years.  I&amp;rsquo;m getting away from those in favor of
using actual Linux boards &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/beaglebone-getting-started/&#34;&gt;(like the Beaglebone that I wrote about recently)&lt;/a&gt;.  But I also am super fond of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/tasmota/&#34;&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s written in the Arduino framework but it&amp;rsquo;s all super-lightweight.  I bet that I can wedge UDP support even into that code base.  UDP requires almost no code and it&amp;rsquo;s easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;risk--data-loss&#34;&gt;Risk:  Data Loss&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some UDP packets may get lost.  Not likely on my pretty good network, but yes.  They might.  Even if I had 3% packet loss though I&amp;rsquo;m not worried.  If I am sending a packet per second and lose 2 seconds worth of data
it&amp;rsquo;s not going to change anything.  And as I mention below, if I lose a command packet then it won&amp;rsquo;t matter either because the declarative control system will fix it.  That&amp;rsquo;s what it&amp;rsquo;s designed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prove-it--udp-code-is-easy&#34;&gt;Prove It:  UDP Code is Easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pulled together a simple C file yesterday while watching TV.  63 lines of code to build a simple CLI program to send a broadcast packet.  Read the code &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/sendudp&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;beaglebone:~&amp;gt; ./sendudp &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;This is just a test&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the output in tcpdump:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mars:~&amp;gt; sudo tcpdump -i enxd0374505d925 -n &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;broadcast&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; and port &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt; -s &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt; -X
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; full protocol decode

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    0x0030:  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0000&lt;/span&gt;                                     ..
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-in-c&#34;&gt;Why in C?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to do this simple example in typescript, or even javascript.  Wow.  The Beaglebone is really low power.  It&amp;rsquo;s slow.  Developing on it with a scripting language is painful, and I can only see
doom in my future if I try to do multiple things on it in a scripting language.  C is still my favorite language, it&amp;rsquo;s showing why again.  It was easy to build, it&amp;rsquo;s insanely fast and it was fun to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, this approach adheres to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy&#34;&gt;Unix Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;.  You should stop and go read that.  Seriously.  I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.  We need more of that thinking these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-this-solve-redundancy&#34;&gt;How Does this Solve Redundancy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All by iteself it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  What do I have now with MQTT?  A bunch of devices, and a broker.  The new model is the same, with the network itself being the broker.  Only now I can add another program to read the packets and
it can operate completely independently of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;listeners&#34;&gt;Listeners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For data coming from sensors it&amp;rsquo;s simple.  The sensor sends data broadcast.  Both listeners &amp;ldquo;hear&amp;rdquo; it and log it away where it needs to go (I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of using &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/&#34;&gt;Amazon CloudWatch&lt;/a&gt; for this,
or maybe &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/&#34;&gt;Amazon TimeStream&lt;/a&gt;).  But regardless, I can have duplicate listeners and control the logic upstream on whether I just keep duplicate data sets or filter dups post-collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;actuators&#34;&gt;Actuators&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For commands being sent to actuators using a UDP packet is equally easy.  I can have more than one command node and it will &amp;ldquo;just work.&amp;rdquo;  Today I have a cronjob sending MQTT messages to the broker at specified times.  It&amp;rsquo;s not
ideal.  Not only is the broker a SPoF as I mentioned above, but as a control system it&amp;rsquo;s really too simple.  What I want is a declarative system where I say &amp;ldquo;I want this device to be in this state over these periods&amp;rdquo; and the controller
actively checks the device state and commands it to be in that state if it isn&amp;rsquo;t.  This solves another problem of using UDP as well:  a lost command is no big deal, since the next time the controller checks the device state and finds it
not to be in the desired state, it will send another command to fix it.  Self-healing (this is how Kubernetes works, by the way).  This is theoretically possible on top of MQTT, but then why do I need that complex message bus?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;addressing&#34;&gt;Addressing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astute reader will wonder &amp;ldquo;what about addressing?&amp;rdquo;  The UDP broadcast goes to everything.  So the device needs a way to determine &amp;ldquo;is this for me?&amp;rdquo;  Today over MQTT every device has a name.  So I don&amp;rsquo;t think it would be too hard to just
use that name for things that are directed messages.  The data is there to use, it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of deciding the formating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;security&#34;&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MQTT supports options for encryption and authentication.  Those are easy to add too.  The UDP packet could be either encrypted or signed (HMAC) with a shared key and you&amp;rsquo;d get the same level of protection that MQTT offers today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tasmota-changes&#34;&gt;Tasmota Changes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very fond of &lt;a href=&#34;https://tasmota.github.io/docs/&#34;&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt; and especially the &lt;a href=&#34;https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-1-smart-home-automation-relay/&#34;&gt;Shelly 1&lt;/a&gt;.  Today these are either serial, HTTP, or MQTT based for commands.  To make
my dream system come true I&amp;rsquo;ll have to look at adding in a UDP option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;incremental-development&#34;&gt;Incremental Development?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some new ideas are basically &amp;ldquo;all or nothing&amp;rdquo; and you find yourself in a chicken-before-the-egg scenario.  It&amp;rsquo;s clear that I could start this UDP solution for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/tasmota/&#34;&gt;swimming pool sensor&lt;/a&gt; problem first.
I&amp;rsquo;m already working on using a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/beaglebone-getting-started/&#34;&gt;Beaglebone Black&lt;/a&gt; for collecting all that sensor data.  I can start there, and then migrate more devices as I make progress with Tasmota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-example&#34;&gt;Practical Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my beaglebone I wrote a script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;beaglebone:~&amp;gt; cat ./sendtemp.sh
TEMP=`cat /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input`
TEMPC=`awk &amp;#34;BEGIN {print $TEMP/1000}&amp;#34;`
echo $TEMPC
./sendudp 8000 $TEMPC
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and if you run it you can get the data over the network:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mars:~&amp;gt; sudo tcpdump -i enxd0374505d925 -n &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;broadcast&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; and port &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8000&lt;/span&gt; -s &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt; -X

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I need to write a data collector for the UDP packets and come up with a common payload format (that includes addressing and multiple data elements).  I&amp;rsquo;m leaning towards a JSON payload format, to be honest, and then
using nodejs for the controller.  The host for the controller software will be an Intel Nuc, most likely, or maybe another lower end linux box like a Beaglebone.  The Nuc&amp;rsquo;s are wonderful but they do use about 14W
&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/power/&#34;&gt;last time I checked&lt;/a&gt;.  A Beaglebone supposedly uses 6W.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have my &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0777H8MS8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;power meter&lt;/a&gt; handy - had to
order a new one - so I&amp;rsquo;m going off the spec sheet.  As I dial my power use back more and more I may just shift to Beaglebones for these tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a high level the controller won&amp;rsquo;t be all that hard.  It basically will listen for data packets and forward them off, probably to Amazon Cloudwatch.  I did a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/gonetmon&#34;&gt;lot of work&lt;/a&gt;
on &lt;a href=&#34;https://prometheus.io/&#34;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; a few years back, but I really don&amp;rsquo;t like their pull model of data collection.  It&amp;rsquo;s the opposite of what I am doing in my new approach.  So the aggregation/visualization part
still needs some thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beaglebone Black - Getting Started</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/beaglebone-getting-started/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/beaglebone-getting-started/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Getting Started with the Beaglebone Black (Again)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Beaglebone Black (BB) is an alternative SBC to the Raspberry Pi.  There are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2021/01/20/beaglebone-vs-raspberry-pi-which-sbc-is-better/&#34;&gt;writeups on which is better&lt;/a&gt; but for my
application it all comes down to one thing:  I can get an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/BeagleBoard/102110423?qs=sGAEpiMZZMv0NwlthflBi0Dbt%2FW0HGv%2F0Zrk8JqjxbQ%3D&#34;&gt;industrial version&lt;/a&gt; that has a max operating
temperature of +85C - that&amp;rsquo;s 185F folks.  The environment I am installing my project in is a small room that gets pretty hot.  I&amp;rsquo;ve put some ESP8266 and ESP32 in there and they died.  Heat?  Maybe.  Might be the humidity
and the salt air too.  So my plan is to put the BB in an enclosure to protect it from the air, but since it will get hot in there I need a wide temp range device.  And I may need to add some active cooling.  More on that
later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-project&#34;&gt;What Project?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started writing about my &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/tasmota/&#34;&gt;Solar Pool Heating Project before&lt;/a&gt; but have not really had much time for it.  I &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/post/webrtc-phone/&#34;&gt;changed roles at AWS&lt;/a&gt; and have been heads down coding (yes!).  I&amp;rsquo;ll post something about that
next week when my first official AWS blog posts.  So all my side projects went on hold for a bit.  Besides, turns out I don&amp;rsquo;t get good enough WiFi signal in the pool casita anyway, so I had to wait until phase
two of our remodel when the conduit gets pulled so that I have real networking there (and yes, I&amp;rsquo;ll add another Ubiquity AP too).  In the next month I&amp;rsquo;ll have all that sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the meantime I updated my board with the latest Debian.  It is nice that the board has an onboard 4GB MMC so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to use an SD card.&lt;br&gt;
I then wired up my trusty DS18b20 and started playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/bb.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed &lt;a href=&#34;https://elinux.org/EBC_Exercise_31_Dallas_1-Wire&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; and I can definitely read the temperature.  Progress!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0&amp;gt; cat temp1_input
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;23062&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide 23062 by 1000 to get the reading in C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frameworks&#34;&gt;Frameworks?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my day job has me neck deep in typescript anyway, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d look into &lt;a href=&#34;https://cylonjs.com/&#34;&gt;CylonJS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://morphocode.com/starting-with-johnny-five-on-the-beaglebone/&#34;&gt;JohnnyFive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ooops-cylonjs-does-not-support-the-ds18b20&#34;&gt;Ooops, CylonJS does not support the DS18b20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I did find a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rafaelkelly/cylon-one-wire&#34;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt; that supports it but there&amp;rsquo;s no README or docs.  Moving along.  These aren&amp;rsquo;t the droids you are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;johnny-five-also-does-not-support-the-ds18b20&#34;&gt;Johnny-Five also does not support the DS18b20&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmmm.  Not sure it&amp;rsquo;s supported here either, according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://johnny-five.io/platform-support/&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.  Or &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/julianduque/beaglebone-io&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  How can this be?  It does say that the P9_12
pin is supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-does-it-matter&#34;&gt;But Does it Matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading that value from /sys/devices is trivial.  Does one actually need the framework for much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-for-today&#34;&gt;Conclusion for Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure I want the restrictions of using a framework, to be honest.   But it will have to wait for another day.  It&amp;rsquo;s Thanksgiving and my time is up.  My son is
flying home today, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to pick him up from the airport!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to the (Phone) Future!  Changing roles!</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/webrtc-phone/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;The only constant is change!  And&amp;hellip; sometimes things come full circle.  I&amp;rsquo;m changing roles at AWS.  Back to the Future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start a new role at AWS on November 1.  I&amp;rsquo;m joining the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/&#34;&gt;Amazon Chime SDK&lt;/a&gt; team to form their Developer Advocacy/Technical Evangalism function.  My job will be to help folks learn how to best use this amazing AWS service to revolutionize their communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it?  I tell non-technical folks that it&amp;rsquo;s cloud services that let you build your own Zoom&amp;hellip; with or without using real phone calls to connect.  Need a way to call some phone numbers and play a message?  Need a way to let callers do some interactions from their phone keys to navigate to the right person?  Need to dial in from a phone and join a meeting?  Amazon Chime SDK does all that, and much more! Please check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/faq/&#34;&gt;Chime SDK FAQs&lt;/a&gt; to learn more from the official channels.  Chime SDK is literally the building blocks for Amazon&amp;rsquo;s own Chime applications - exposed for others to use as a cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question some of you might be asking is &amp;ldquo;why?&amp;rdquo;  For that, my friends, we need a history lesson.  The tl;dr version is that I spent much of the earlier part of my career building software for telephony, internet telephony (VoIP), and then streaming video.  Then cloud came along and I worked at Rackspace, more video, Cisco (video and then cloud), and then to AWS&amp;hellip; again in cloud.  Chime SDK is what happens when you bring all that telephony and video and make it 100% cloud-enabled.  It&amp;rsquo;s like folding the first half of my career over onto the second half in some kind of time-mobius strip of technology.  It&amp;rsquo;s perfect for me!  WebRTC meet the PSTN!  This technology used to be hard to build (I know - I built it once!) but now it&amp;rsquo;s vastly easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/webrtc-phone.png&#34; width=&#34;60%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are at the begining of a new age of communication.  The Pandemic locked us all at home, doing meetings over Zoom, WebEx, and Amazon&amp;rsquo;s own Chime (which many folks don&amp;rsquo;t even know is like Zoom and WebEx, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s better in many ways).  How we work has changed.  We will do more online meetings, more collaboration, more &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; from non-traditional places.  The phone system is still a core bedrock for most folks, but the Internet is a river of change.  Chime SDK melds those two worlds - in a very cloudy way.   The ability to generate voice from &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/polly/&#34;&gt;Amazon Polly&lt;/a&gt; and transcribe voice into text using &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/transcribe/&#34;&gt;Amazon Transcribe&lt;/a&gt; changes the game completely.  And when you starting tying ML/AI into the mix&amp;hellip;  it&amp;rsquo;s a whole new ball game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did my hacking before I made the leap.  If you are interested, check out my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/firstCall&#34;&gt;firstCall&lt;/a&gt; app that does the most basic thing one can do:  call into a real phone number, have it play a recording and hang up.  It uses the Chime SDK, of course, but also the AWS CDK, IAM, and Lambda services.  It was a fun hack to just kick the tires and see what was real.  It&amp;rsquo;s REAL!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get started and see where we can take this technology.  Back to the Future!  &amp;ldquo;Roads?  Where we are going we don&amp;rsquo;t need roads!&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s the cloud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer:  as usual, all opinions here are my own and not my employers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>VLC Error</title>

        &lt;p&gt;A bug in VLC?  Grrrr.  Reminds me of the old days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m playing with my video cameras this morning and moved some displays to a new computer with a fresh install of Ubuntu.  And VLC is broken.  It just won&amp;rsquo;t play the stream on the new machine.  Works like a champ on the older one.  Someone else had this problem, it seems, so I added to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server/issues/223&#34;&gt;github issue&lt;/a&gt;.  I have a sneaky suspicion this is a regression.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power of xdotool in X11</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/xdotool/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/xdotool/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;X11&amp;rsquo;s xdotool cli is snazzy, and solved an annoying window placement problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a set of Ubiquity Cameras that I use for basic video surveilance.  I run a set of tiled windows on an older linux notebook on a corner of my desk so I can see what&amp;rsquo;s happening.  VLC is great for this, and you can even tell it to restart a window if the stream fails, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cvlc --loop rtsp://your.url.here &amp;amp;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ndash;loop is a neat trick.  I have a bash script that starts an instance for each camera.  There&amp;rsquo;s supposedly a way to do many video panes in one VLC window but I&amp;rsquo;ve not researched that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.videolan.org/VLC_command-line_help/&#34;&gt;VLC man page&lt;/a&gt; the CLI commands to position the window don&amp;rsquo;t work (&amp;ndash;video-x and &amp;ndash;video-y).  I got tired of manually positioning the windows and finally solved it: with xdotool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the trick:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cvlc --loop rtsp://url.to.my.cam.on.back.stairs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;sleep &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;xdotool search --sync --onlyvisible --name vlc set_window --name &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;stairs&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;win&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;xdotool search stairs&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;xdotool windowmove $win &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;640&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;719&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I repeated that for each camera, setting the screen positions I wanted.  I have more than will fit on the screen easily and the last two windows overlap the middle ones a bit.  But to &amp;ldquo;raise focus&amp;rdquo; of the windows that matter to me more I just did this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;win&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;xdotool search gate&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;xdotool windowactivate $win
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;win&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;xdotool search inside&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;xdotool windowactivate $win
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those windows are now on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always knew there was a way to do this in X11 but I never dug into it before today.  The xdotool is a full-on automation tool, able to send mouse and key events, watch for window events and take actions, etc.  It&amp;rsquo;s the low-level primitive for creating any X11 window manager automation that you need.  Very slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have not tested yet is the &amp;ndash;loop functionality.  It may respawn a new window that then is out of it&amp;rsquo;s set position (and likely has the wrong name?).  I don&amp;rsquo;t know yet.  What I will need is a way to detect that and then move the window to the right place again.  That may be tricky and require some logic to determine which one respawned.  That may need a real daemon type of application&amp;hellip; which means I would need to integrate xdotool into an app.  I wonder if it has libraries?  I&amp;rsquo;ll solve that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For today, I&amp;rsquo;m excited I got my camera window placement automated!  The power of linux.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodnight Twitter</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/goodnight-twitter/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/goodnight-twitter/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Once again, I&amp;rsquo;m the product, being manipulated. This time it&amp;rsquo;s Twitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook-all-over-again&#34;&gt;Facebook all Over Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago I deleted my Facebook account.  It was clear to me that the material they were showing me was provocative and inflamatory.  I really valued the platform to stay in touch with old Navy friends, old friends in general, and news from very local places that don&amp;rsquo;t rise to real news coverage.  But there came a point where things being shoved in my face were annoying me more than the value I was getting.  And, there&amp;rsquo;s the moral part too:  FB is making billions of dollars from pitting Americans against each other.  It&amp;rsquo;s actually their core business model.  I opted out.  They may be in real trouble with the FTC, if &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/why-facebook-is-suddenly-afraid-of-the-ftc&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; is accurate.  Goodnight, Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/nofb.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitter&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stayed on twitter.  Until recently it was some ads but mostly a nice way to follow some tech folks I liked, get news about some new tech projects, hear about some Navy stuff, follow some veterans.  But over the last six monts I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten more and more squeemish.  It&amp;rsquo;s been feeling more and more like how FB used to feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started paying attention to what I was getting fed on Twitter.  A lot of what I wanted to read was NOT showing up.  I could go to someones timeline and see it - but their posts would not show up in my feed.  Twitter&amp;rsquo;s algorithm, you see.  Showing me what they want me to see.  Not necesarily what I want to see, who I followed - but what their system wants me to see to shape me, to get me to see their ads, to manipulate me into spending more time on twitter.  It works amazingy well.  But I can totally see that I&amp;rsquo;m being manipulated.  And frankly, I don&amp;rsquo;t like it. Goodnight, manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also am not buying the claim that &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s a bug&amp;rdquo; that makes one&amp;rsquo;s timeline jump backwards so annoyingly.  I hate it.  But it could be fixed by now.  I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s just part of their system, inserting stuff they want me to read.  Now that I am annoyed by it I think the worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I especially don&amp;rsquo;t like how I am reacting to the feeds I&amp;rsquo;m getting.  It&amp;rsquo;s almost like the algorythoms are TRYING to get under my skin, finding the things I will react to.  Which then would suck me into using Twitter more.  Exactly what they want&amp;hellip; but does it really matter if someone is a jerk about telling everyone they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t recline their airplane seats?  Politics aside, REALLY?  Who cares.  It&amp;rsquo;s just some some random person on the Internet who happen to be wrong.  Goodnight, pointless reply posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/duty_calls.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With credit, of course, to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/386/&#34;&gt;amazing xkcd comics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-im-taking-a-break&#34;&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t delete my account yet - there&amp;rsquo;s a few folks that I DM with who I have not shifted to email yet.  But I think I may be done with the Mega-corp controlled social media bandwagon.  I have a backlog of reading to do (maybe list those in another post), and I want to sharpen my go skills again.  The twitter black hole eats a lot of minutes I could be doing something far more productive.  I&amp;rsquo;ll miss some folks - especially a few hardware hackers that I won&amp;rsquo;t have a way to follow otherwise.  There&amp;rsquo;s definitely some veterans I&amp;rsquo;ll miss.  Some of the cool news I didn&amp;rsquo;t see anywhere else will be gone from my life.  Some funny photos probably.   I bet I&amp;rsquo;ll be happier.  I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you in a few months!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I need to just make a list of blogs to follow.  Got any ideas?  Drop me old fashioned email at &lt;em&gt;gherlein-at-herlein.com&lt;/em&gt;.  Same as it ever was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goodnight Twitter.  Goodnight stars; Goodnight air; Goodnight noises everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;credit-to-the-book-goodnight-moon&#34;&gt;Credit to the Book Goodnight Moon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m moving my daughter away to college so I&amp;rsquo;m a bit reminiscient this week.  Definitely thinking of the great book that I used to read to her and to my son.  If you have small kids, you need &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Goodnight-Moon-Margaret-Wise-Brown-ebook/dp/B01MPZ8KKF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=goodnight+moon&amp;qid=1630428020&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;this book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on MQTT</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/mqtt/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Some Thoughts on MQTT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life has gotten in the way of my pool project, but I do have some thoughts.  I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten small Sonoff plugs set up to turn on and off bug zappers on a cron schedule. I reflashed the units with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tasmota.github.io/docs/&#34;&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt;.  From earlier robotics experiments I was fond of MQTT as a message bus.  Not so much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things do break.  Not often, but they do.  The node I was running MQTT on got a little flaky and it impacted ALL my devices.  That&amp;rsquo;s a classic single point of failure (SPoF) problem.  Not good.  That got me thinking about the larger IoT ecosystem.  So much of it these days assumes MQTT.  Well, at least what I see.  That makes me uncomfortable.  Even for data collection I am not sure it&amp;rsquo;s the right model.  I was thinking about polling my sensors over MQTT topics and then flowing that data to both a local system and the cloud for analysis.  I love Prometheus and was thinking I&amp;rsquo;d use the cool looking &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/inovex/mqtt_blackbox_exporter&#34;&gt;Prometheus Blackbox Exporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back and look at this system.  I have a collection of WiFi-devices all configured to talk on MQTT topics. I have a mosquitto MQTT broker.  I have Prometheus running, and Grafana, and now I add the exporter.  You know, I could just poll the devices directly with an exporter and that&amp;rsquo;s one less common-to-eveything component.  In fact, contrary to the way MQTT works I could take a page out of k8s thinking and have a node controller that has a map of declarative state - the desired state of bug zappers at what times (e.g. like a crontab) and it would be easy to have code check the devices and if they are not in the desired state command them to be in that state.  I could run more than one of that service and be totally idempotent, and thus quite resistant to the loss of any one node of that service.  Tell me again why I am using MQTT?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course there are lots of use cases where MQTT is great.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that mine is one of them.  So life is going to keep me from doing much on the personal hobby front this week, but my brain is sure active on it.  I suspect I can design a very small service that just polls a given device every X seconds and if it&amp;rsquo;s not in the desired state it executes a command to put it in that state.  I could get that desired state from a distriibuted store so that I don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about configuring every controller.  Then I can run a few of those and they will be very lightweight, and since they are simple they probably won&amp;rsquo;t fail much anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my damn bug zappers will turn on and off when they are supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See?  The power of technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Summer</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/summer/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Where am I? Summer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My family is vaccinated, thank goodness, and summer is here.  My daughter graduated high school.  My son is home from college.  I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/tasmota/&#34;&gt;projects in the hopper .&lt;/a&gt; but alas, not done yet. Summer is in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as a note, I am disillusioned with the ESP8266 and ESP32 boards I got for some of these projects.  They have already died in the summer weather.  100F is not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; hot, but damn, these clone boards just seem to die.  The WiFi at least&amp;hellip;  just, gone.  It definitely makes me wonder if I had it right before with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/rpi-zero-w/&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero W&lt;/a&gt;.  No development speedup by using Tasmota, but at least the hardware seems more reliable.  And frankly, the development is linux.  Easy.  No FreeRTOS or embedded foo to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Summer beckons.  The urgency for the solar pool heater is diminished because the dang pool is 91F with no help at all&amp;hellip;  and there are a few other boring home repair tasks that need doing.  I&amp;rsquo;ll get to it.  As they say in Mexico:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ma%C3%B1ana&#34;&gt;mañana&lt;/a&gt; - the second meaning.  Which means &amp;ldquo;not today!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Summertime all.  I hope you can get out of the house and safely enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Playing with Tasmota - A Swimming Pool Story</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Playing around with Tasmota - as the sensing core of an IoT-based swimming pool temperature control system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short post today, due to time.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://tasmota.github.io/docs/&#34;&gt;Tasmota&lt;/a&gt; which is embedded firmware for the ESP8266 and ESP32 (in beta).  If you want to get started FAST this is what you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need the ability to flash an ESP8266.  Once you can do that, you can pluck the generic build and flash the device.  It reboots and comes up as a WiFi Access Point (AP).  You connect to that AP and configure the credentials for your own AP.  It reboots, and then you connect to it again and configure logging, MQTT, and tell it what is connected to the GPIO pins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This deserves a real post, with screen shots and photos but I don&amp;rsquo;t have time today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware though, and don&amp;rsquo;t rush these things.  I grabbed the wrong power supply for a test and plugged it into the ESP8266.  Yes indeed, the 5V to 3.3V regulator did NOT like 12VDC applied. I turned around to connect to it with the web browser and by the time I realized it was not online I started to smell it.  I let the magic smoke out.  Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/smoke.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One blown up ESP9266.  I&amp;rsquo;m glad they are cheap!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you thought I was going to say I dropped it in the pool right?  Ha ha ha. I&amp;rsquo;d tell you a story about building a floating pool temp thermometer but I definitely don&amp;rsquo;t have time for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I do have time to tell you is that it just works.  This is what I am using for my home IoT foundation.  I already have it in production use on two outside lights and my basement lights using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-1-smart-home-automation-relay/&#34;&gt;Shelly 1 Relays&lt;/a&gt;.  These are hacker-friendly relays built around the ESP8266 that actually expose the pins so you can re-flash them.  Love these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the things I am currently working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water Flow Sensor &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00VKAT7EE?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;(this one)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water Tank (Cisterna) Level Detector &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07211T6Y6?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;(these)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water Temp Sensor &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07H3P8LRT?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;(this sensor)&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07L67CMZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;(this thermowell)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electronics on all this works, and I can measure and send data to an MQTT broker from the bench with all the sensors connected to a breadboard. It&amp;rsquo;s the &amp;ldquo;put in a real world box and power it&amp;rdquo; part that I&amp;rsquo;m working on now.  The hard part!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also am measuring sunlight.  I am NOT using a light sensor, but instead am using a tiny solar panel &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XTS9SQ1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;(this one)&lt;/a&gt; which is $3 each and rugged as hell.  Drop the output across a 50-50 volatege divider and read the split using the Analog input on the chip.  BEWARE: most ESP8266/ESP32 read full range (0-3.3V) but some are 0-1V.  Check it and adjust your divider appropriately.  You can put the voltage divider resistors in the package with the panel and pot it with epoxy &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00VXV9YZ2?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;(this stuff)&lt;/a&gt; and run two wires out into the sun with no worries about capacitive issues on an I2C signal.  And unlikely to die in the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, none of this is working anywhere but my bench yet.  I need to get a move on packaging it up so it can live out in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a swimming pool, and I have a solar pool heater.  It&amp;rsquo;s basically some black glass tubes that sit in the hot sun and the water inside gets hot.  Periodically you open the valve and the water is flushed into the pool, making it warmer.  To get the most efficiency you want to open the valve once the water is as hot as it&amp;rsquo;s going to get, assuming the pool water actually needs to be warmed.  The system came with a timer for the electronic valve, which does not work well since sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s cloudy, sometimes the water is warm enough already, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I&amp;rsquo;m adding a temp sensor in the water recirc flow to tell me what the pool temp actually is.  I was building a floating sensor, powered by a solar panel, but&amp;hellip; well.  Lots of problems with that idea.  That&amp;rsquo;s another post.  The valve from the solar water heater will get a Shelly 1 to control it.  Basically I will measure the temp of the pool water and the strength of the sunlight.  The temp of the water in the glass tubes is harder to measure since it&amp;rsquo;s not flowing.  I can sort of measure it with a temp sensor clamped to the copper piping, which is what I will do.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t trust it, since without flow it&amp;rsquo;s just the temp at that spot.  Plus, it will be in the sun itself.  So I don&amp;rsquo;t really trust that data and if the long wire run has too much capacitance for the one-wire sensor to be read then I won&amp;rsquo;t even install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, I&amp;rsquo;ll constantly watch the pool water temp and strength of the sun.  The solar panel is outputing volage proportional to the energy delivered by the sun.  That can be calculated as &amp;ldquo;volt-seconds&amp;rdquo; of energy.  The temperature rise of the water in the in the heater glass tubes will be proportional to that.  A duration of water heating up is a &amp;ldquo;baking period.&amp;rdquo;  Periodically I will open the valve and measure the increase in pool temp that results.  I&amp;rsquo;ll program it to try different baking periods and measure the resutls.  Within a few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ll have enough empirical data to know how many volt-seconds are needed to accomplish the optimum increase in pool temp.  Then I can modify my control algorithm to just go from that and keep my pool at the best temp I can using ONLY the sun for energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I have a sense that I could use some ML for this.  I could possibly use the data I gather over a few weeks to train an ML model to maintain as close to the desired temperature as possible.  And I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do this as a practical project to &amp;ldquo;learn by doing&amp;rdquo; as I start to do more IoT ML work.  Should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the plan anyway.  I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know how it goes in the real world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wait-what-about-the-water-flow-and-tank-sensors&#34;&gt;Wait, What About the Water Flow and Tank Sensors?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah yes.  Those.  Somone left a hose on to water the yard and that just happened to match up with the City doing some work on the water system.  This resulted in my underground water tank (Cisterna) getting drained, which then triggered the float valve on the water pump to shut down to protect it, which resulted in no water pressure in the house at all.  Bad juju.  Can&amp;rsquo;t even flush the toilets.  Bad juju.  A quick test with the hose filling a 2-liter bottle told me the flow rate:  my hose delivers 6 liters of water per minute.  Yes, Virginia, my 5000 liter cisterna can get drained dry in 13 hours.  Overnight, basically.  And if no one is home, you can have an unhappy house the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are currently blind to that scenario, especially from remote, I am going to put a flow meter in and if water flow exceeds some normal amount for more than say, and hour, it will send an alarm.  Likewise the float valves in the cisterna.  If the level starts to go down then we should know it so we can reduce water consumption drastically so we have a water supply at least.  I am definitely planning on tying this to &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/&#34;&gt;AWS Greengrass&lt;/a&gt; and use &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/sns/?whats-new-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;whats-new-cards.sort-order=desc&#34;&gt;AWS SNS&lt;/a&gt; to text me when these kinds of alarms go off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water flow meter is easy since it can go inline near the pressure tank where I have easy power available, and it&amp;rsquo;s in a protected space.  The cisterna is under my garage floor.  I have 240VAC there for the water pump.  So I had to buy one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/209-VCE05US05&#34;&gt;these &lt;/a&gt; small power supply modules and am potting it inside a water proof box to sit near the tank.  Not at all sure that&amp;rsquo;s a good solution, since the WiFi may not get through the concrete to where my AP is.  I may end up having to run some long, thin wires and put the ESP8266 somewhere where it&amp;rsquo;s radio can see.  Only testing will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-else&#34;&gt;What Else?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I do plan to tie my &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.ui.com/collections/unifi-protect&#34;&gt;Unifi cameras&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;blog-cards.sort-order=desc&#34;&gt;AWS Rekognition&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve worked through a &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/creating-object-recognition-with-espressif-esp32/&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; about how to do it with an ESP32 as a demo.  My actual architecture would be different, and not only because I can react to the Unifi Protect motion sensing and &lt;a href=&#34;http://your.camera.ip.address/snap.jpeg&#34;&gt;grab an image directly from the camera&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a bit hacky.  I wish Ubiquity would just expose an MQTT feed, but hey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15901&#34;&gt;Weather Meter Kit&lt;/a&gt; and actually tried to test the wind speed annemometer.  No joy.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/d/1/e/0/6/DS-15901-Weather_Meter.pdf&#34;&gt;datasheet&lt;/a&gt; says 1 contact closure per second equals 2.4km/hour of wind.  But tasmota does not count those pulses, for some reason.  Same basic reading as the water flow meter - pulses per second - but no joy.  I know the pulses are happening too, because I can see them on my scope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/scope.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set that aside for later.  I need the pool and water tank done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you see, I have a TON of projects queued up.  And these are not just learning projects, but stuff that I really want to get done and use in my normal life.  On top of trying to learn Spanish and my very full time job at AWS it&amp;rsquo;s going to be a busy year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Progress on ESP32 and FreeRTOS</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/freertos-helper-esp32/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Apr 2021 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/freertos-helper-esp32/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Progress, but not where I want it to be.  But it builds and installs the FreeRTOS AWS IoT demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building embedded code is a pickle, and you can get totally confused easily.  Different examples use different build systems.  There&amp;rsquo;s a whole Arduino ecosystem.  Then PlatformIO, that overlaps with Arduino, but also can directly drive a CMake project.  Then there&amp;rsquo;s the chip vendors, such as Espressif, who have &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/&#34;&gt;their own ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; too.  Add in FreeRTOS, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos&#34;&gt;fork that AWS has done&lt;/a&gt;, and it gets matrix-math complicated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t pretend I totally understand, but at least I can reliably build the ESP32 FreeRTOS from AWS demo code now.  I wanted to build it all from a makefile external to the tree, but the build tooling depends on setting a ton of environment variables.  And make spawns sub-shells, and getting them to inherit all of those correctly has wasted a lot of my time this weekend.  So I punted and just write it into a single shell script and called that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the whole project here:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/esp32-amazon-freertos-helper&#34;&gt;Amazon FreeRTOS ESP32 Helper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really it&amp;rsquo;s just a learning exercise.  To actually have a real project you want to structure your code repo differently.  More on that another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, in the interest of sharing, there are a few things to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using the config helper script provided in the FreeRTOS tree.  You fill out a JSON config file and run a python script and it creates the AWS IoT thing, the certs, the policy, and then associates the policy to the cert and the cert to the thing.  It also does all the work for you to embed the cert binaries into the header files.  Again, this is not for production use but for learning it&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is documented, and I have not automated around it, but that script does have more features.  If you just run the script over and over it will fail, since the thing/certs/policy already exist.  But, you can clean it all up like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd amazon-freertos/tools/aws_config_quick_start
python SetupAWS.py cleanup
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then you can start over cleanly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dboard-parameter&#34;&gt;DBOARD Parameter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important command in the chain is this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake -DVENDOR=espressif -DBOARD=esp32_wrover_kit -DCOMPILER=xtensa-esp32 -S . -B build -GNinja
idf.py build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;But&amp;hellip;  which board do you have?  The build system &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws/amazon-freertos/blob/master/vendors/espressif/boards/esp32/CMakeLists.txt&#34;&gt;supports a few options&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esp32_devkitc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esp32_wrover_kit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;esp32_plus_ecc608a_devkitc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of the last one.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a few pages that outline details on many ESP32 boards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/modules-and-boards.html&#34;&gt;Espressif - Modules and Boards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nabto.com/guide-to-iot-esp-32/&#34;&gt;Nabto - ESP32 for IoT: A Complete Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it really seems to come down to which module is used.  There is the new &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32c3/&#34;&gt;ESP32-C3&lt;/a&gt; that is being sampled and not supported in FreeRTOS anymore, and then basically it looks like the ESP32-D0WDQ6 and ESP32-D0WD.  The D means dual core.  If it has an S it means Single core, but I can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find any parts that use that chip.  All the boards I have use the ESP32-D0WDQ6:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NP5LVFH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;M5Stack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/SparkFun-PID-13907-ESP32-Thing/dp/B01MG9BNEN/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sparkfun+esp32+thing&amp;qid=1617551270&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3&#34;&gt;Sparkfun ESP32 Thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Haudang-ESP32-PICO-KIT-Development-ESP32-PICO-D4-USB-UART/dp/B091C9521Y/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ESP32-PICO-D4&amp;qid=1617551311&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-5&#34;&gt;ESP32-PICO-D4 Dev Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S5PVZKV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;ESP32-CAM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08PTRLLDC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;D1-Mini&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B075C7WVJF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;ESP32-Ethernet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you know what chip your ESP32 uses?  You use the &amp;rsquo;esptool read_mac&amp;rsquo; command, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gherlein@mars:~/src/aws$ esptool read_mac
esptool.py v2.8
Found 1 serial ports
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
Connecting....
Detecting chip type... ESP32
Chip is ESP32D0WDQ6 (revision 1)
Features: WiFi, BT, Dual Core, 240MHz, VRef calibration in efuse, Coding Scheme None
Crystal is 40MHz
MAC: 3c:61:05:28:dc:64
Enabling default SPI flash mode...
MAC: 3c:61:05:28:dc:64
Hard resetting via RTS pin...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That example is for the &amp;ldquo;D1 Mini&amp;rdquo; boards ($5 each, Amazon Prime - likely WAY cheaper from Asia).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, as best as I can tell the &amp;rsquo;esp32_wrover_kit&amp;rsquo; is the right parameter to pass into -DBOARD.  I need to dig deeper and find out what those other setting really do.  This seems to work, and it&amp;rsquo;s consistent with other examples I have found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-and-next-steps&#34;&gt;Conclusion and Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made good progress and learned a lot.  My next step is to learn how to make these work in production.  There&amp;rsquo;s an AWS workshop to build a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/connected-drink-dispenser-workshop&#34;&gt;Connected Drink Dispenser&lt;/a&gt; that I may build, or at least model a new code tree from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of things I plan to build, but I am currently wondering if the ESP32 is right for my weather station.  I have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B084DBXMPX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;sensors&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B013W1AJUY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;temp/humidity/pressure&lt;/a&gt; and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll build a single board to interface them all to the ESP32.  But that&amp;rsquo;s a post for another day, for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to Basics:  AWS IoT C SDK</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A few quick notes on getting the AWS IoT C SDK running on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played a lot this past weekend with AWS IoT things.  I finally decided that my friends advice was good:  get something running on a known, reliable platform and then change variables once I understood what I was doing.  So I literally went right back to basics:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C&#34;&gt;the IoT Embedded C SDK&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;m going to get that running, then I&amp;rsquo;ll go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/espressif/esp-aws-iot&#34;&gt;ESP32 port&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-works-but-details-matter&#34;&gt;It Works, But Details Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS IoT has security built in, and the details matter.  I just wanted to do the simple &amp;ldquo;mqtt_demo_mutual_auth&amp;rdquo; case.  I spent some time getting things right.  Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to say this is the ONLY way to do it&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s what I had to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-this&#34;&gt;Why Do This?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out this is hugely valuable.  If you do this, and get it working, you know that your AWS-side works.  You can work it all out at the linux command line where logs are easy and the iterative process of development is trivial.  Trying to do this AND deal with flashing an embedded controller is adding a lot of variables for things to go wrong.  And makes it really hard to troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have all this working, you can translate the SAME thing name and topics to your embedded code and at least know it was working on linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-the-aws-console&#34;&gt;On the AWS Console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;make-a-thing&#34;&gt;Make a Thing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with making a thing in the Console.  Naviage to &amp;ldquo;AWS IoT &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Getting Started&amp;rdquo; and select &amp;ldquo;Onboard a device&amp;rdquo; by clicking &amp;ldquo;Get Started&amp;rdquo; and then click &amp;ldquo;Get started&amp;rdquo; again on the next screen.  I selected &amp;ldquo;Linux/OSX&amp;rdquo; and Python, then clicked &amp;ldquo;Next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed important:  I named my thing &amp;ldquo;testclient&amp;rdquo; - discovered through trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the zip by clicking on &amp;ldquo;Linux/OSX&amp;rdquo; and save the file locally.  In a local terminal, unzip that file to a folder and remember that location.  You should have these files now:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;connect_device_package.zip
start.sh
testclient.cert.pem
testclient.private.key
testclient.public.key
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to test the keys, follow the normal directions in the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;create-a-policy-that-matches-the-demo&#34;&gt;Create a Policy That Matches the Demo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy that was created automatically above is good for the python test code that was in the zip file, but not for the C SDK.  In the Console, navigate to Secure &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Policies and click &amp;ldquo;Create&amp;rdquo; on the upper right side.  Name the policy &amp;ldquo;testclient-policy&amp;rdquo; and click &amp;ldquo;Advanced mode&amp;rdquo; to open an inline editor.  Paste this policy, replacing $REGION:$ACCOUNT_NUMBER with the region string and account number for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &amp;#34;Version&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;2012-10-17&amp;#34;,
  &amp;#34;Statement&amp;#34;: [
    {
      &amp;#34;Effect&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Allow&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Action&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;iot:Connect&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Resource&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;arn:aws:iot:$REGION:$ACCOUNT_NUMBER:client/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}&amp;#34;
    },
    {
      &amp;#34;Effect&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Allow&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Action&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;iot:Subscribe&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Resource&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;arn:aws:iot:$REGION:$ACCOUNT_NUMBER:topicfilter/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}/example/topic&amp;#34;
    },
    {
      &amp;#34;Effect&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Allow&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Action&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;iot:Receive&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Resource&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;arn:aws:iot:$REGION:$ACCOUNT_NUMBER:topic/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}/example/topic&amp;#34;
    },
    {
      &amp;#34;Effect&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;Allow&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Action&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;iot:Publish&amp;#34;,
      &amp;#34;Resource&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;arn:aws:iot:$REGION:$ACCOUNT_NUMBER:topic/${iot:Connection.Thing.ThingName}/example/topic&amp;#34;
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click &amp;ldquo;Create&amp;rdquo; to make the policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;associate-the-policy-with-the-certs&#34;&gt;Associate the Policy with the Certs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is important&lt;/strong&gt;.  Miss this and you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to communicate over MQTT.  Naviage to the Console Manage &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; Things and select the &amp;rsquo;testclient&amp;rsquo; thing you created.  You should see that it has a certificate attached.  Click on that cert.  You will be taken to that certicate configuration.  Navigating to the cert in this way ensures that you have the right cert selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click Actions in the right corner and select &amp;ldquo;Attach policy.&amp;rdquo;  You will get a drop-down dialog box listing the policies you have created.  Select the new &amp;ldquo;testclient-policy&amp;rdquo; that you just created above, and click &amp;ldquo;Attach.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;all-this-is-important&#34;&gt;All this is IMPORTANT&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The certs ensure that only authorized clients can connect, and that clients can trust that the endpoint really is AWS, and that the communications will be secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The policy limits what the client can do.  Specifically, that policy allows any thing name to connect to the MQTT broker, subscribe, send and receive to/from any topic named like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ThingName/example/topic
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The client CANNOT use any other topics at all.  This is a majority of the point of AWS IoT:  to provide a common service while ensuring high security for all the clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-the-build-pc-linux-only-was-tested&#34;&gt;On the Build PC (Linux only was tested)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;clone-the-sdk&#34;&gt;Clone the SDK&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To proceed to the SDK testing, clone the repo locally per the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C.git
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;find-your-aws-endpoint&#34;&gt;Find your AWS Endpoint&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way is to use the AWS CLI:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;configure-the-demo&#34;&gt;Configure the Demo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to ensure you have cmake installed.  Run this command, filling in your details.  IMPORTANT:  don&amp;rsquo;t use relative paths for the cert/key files.  Use the fully qualified path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake -S. -Bbuild -DAWS_IOT_ENDPOINT=&amp;#34;a11cxor2mooi1v-ats.iot.us-west-1.amazonaws.com&amp;#34; -DCLIENT_CERT_PATH=&amp;#34;/home/gherlein/certs/testclient.cert.pem&amp;#34; -DCLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=&amp;#34;/home/gherlein/certs/testclient.private.key&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, generate the makefile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cmake -S. -Bbuild
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all went well, you should see this at the end of your output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- Configuring done
-- Generating done
-- Build files have been written to: /home/gherlein/src/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/build
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, build:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd build
make -j8 ## pick a number less than 8 if you so choose
cd bin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should now see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gherlein@mars:~/src/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-embedded-C/build/bin$ ls

      <title>Dabbling into ESP32 and FreeRTOS</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Dipping a toe into the FreeRTOS ESP32 world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not impressed.  That&amp;rsquo;s got to be my overwhelming opinion at the moment.  I know better than to try to blog when I am frustrated so this is not going to be a technical diatribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time this weekend trying to get FreeRTOS running on the ESP32 following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/getting_started_espressif.html&#34;&gt;AWS Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt;.  I submitted a lot of suggestions for doc improvement, and frankly never got it working.  I did build a binary, finally, but it just crashed constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend, mentor and former boss Scott Francis suggested I look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/NXP-Semiconductors/OM40007UL?qs=W0yvOO0ixfFR96hPnAtATw%3D%3D&#34;&gt;NXP LPC54018&lt;/a&gt;, so I bought one.  In the embedded world, it&amp;rsquo;s all about the quality of the total ecosystem.  Libraries, docs, support forums.  NXP is solid, he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with the Espressif ESP families (ESP32 and ESP8266) is that in the Arduino universe they have that ecosystem.  Mostly the libraries work, and since there are lots of folks using them there&amp;rsquo;s at least some support.  The IDF kits for writing code are solid, in my experience.  They just work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s really an investment thing:  Arduino and makers are where the ESP family makes bank.  Put the money there.  For more &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;professional&amp;rdquo; projects that might require FreeRTOS the tooling and ecosystem is different.  That&amp;rsquo;s my guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have a backlog of projects now.  My weather station kit arrived so I need to instrument that. I was planning on FreeRTOS/ESP32 but now I&amp;rsquo;ll go back to the working Arduinio code I had running.  WORKING CODE WINS.  I&amp;rsquo;ll hold my nose at the Arduino ecosystem, this time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onwards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>ESP32-C3 First Playing</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32c3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32c3/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Finally got a few minutes to play withe the ESP32-C3 DevKit that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EspressifSystem&#34;&gt;Espressif&lt;/a&gt; was kind enough to ship.  So I made a blinky light using the onboard &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf&#34;&gt;WS2812 LED&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not an expert in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freertos.org/&#34;&gt;FreeRTOS&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf&#34;&gt;ESP IDF&lt;/a&gt; but I have dabbled a bit.  I was building my RBOT project around the ESP32 (&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/boards/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/i2c-for-robot/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I thought about &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/rpi-zero-w/&#34;&gt;shifting to an RPi ZeroW&lt;/a&gt; but then I got busy.  I &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/ending-2020/&#34;&gt;changed jobs&lt;/a&gt; and have focussed more on cloud-side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A while back on twitter &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EspressifSystem&#34;&gt;John Lee of Espressif&lt;/a&gt; tweeted that he had some samples and I was lucky enough to get one.  At the time, I was not sure what it even was - but a new chip from Espressif is something I definitely wanted to play with!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new ESP32-C3 is basically an ESP8266 killer.  It&amp;rsquo;s cheaper, and it&amp;rsquo;s more powerful!  It&amp;rsquo;s not really available yet but it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s only &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/espressif-systems/ESP32-C3-MINI-1-N4/13877574?utm_campaign=buynow&amp;utm_medium=aggregator&amp;WT.z_cid=ref_findchips_standard&amp;utm_source=findchips&#34;&gt;$1.80&lt;/a&gt; while the ESP8266 is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.verical.com/pd/espressif-systems-802-11-wireless-lan-ESP8266EX-6374640?utm_campaign=verical_findchips_2021&amp;utm_currency=&amp;utm_medium=aggregator&amp;utm_source=findchips&amp;utm_content=inv_listing&#34;&gt;$1.84&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackaday.com/2021/02/08/hands-on-the-risc-v-esp32-c3-will-be-your-new-esp8266/&#34;&gt;Hackaday&lt;/a&gt; article has a ton about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s really good about this is that the toolchain is the same as for the ESP32 - and one can assume that Espressif will probably extend their AWS FreeRTOS IoT support to this chip like they have for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/freertos/latest/userguide/getting_started_espressif.html&#34;&gt;full ESP32&lt;/a&gt;.  But in the meantime I just wanted to get familiar with the chip and the toolchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/hw-reference/esp32c3/user-guide-devkitm-1.html&#34;&gt;docs&lt;/a&gt; are the usual Espressif excellent.  I got the &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; running within a few minutes.  But they put a cool &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/WS2812.pdf&#34;&gt;WS2812 RGB LED&lt;/a&gt; on the board so I poked at how to enable that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The docs don&amp;rsquo;t cover this yet - after all, the boards are still sample only. But, looking at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/SCH_ESP32-C3-DEVKITM-1_V1_20200915A.pdf&#34;&gt;schematic&lt;/a&gt; I could see that the LED was wired to GPIO8.  I looked around for libraries to drive it and one blog mentioned that the example folder had some code for an LED strip.  So I looked:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ls ~/esp/esp-idf/examples/peripherals/rmt/led_strip/
CMakeLists.txt  components  main  Makefile  README.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the box it&amp;rsquo;s not going to work.  I copied that folder into ~esp and then did&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;idf.py menuconfig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Select &amp;ldquo;Example Configuration&amp;rdquo; and make these changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;(8) RMT TX GPIO
(1) Number of LEDS in a strip
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, the LED is on GPIO8 and there&amp;rsquo;s only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And suddenly I am almost blinded by the light!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/esp32c3.png&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to get serious and do some more reading and playing with FreeRTOS!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kinesis Video Streams - Just Getting Started</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/kinesis-video-streams/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/kinesis-video-streams/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Just started playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/?amazon-kinesis-video-streams-resources-blog.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;amazon-kinesis-video-streams-resources-blog.sort-order=desc&#34;&gt;Amazon Kinesis Video Streams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to get around to Kinesis video streams but&amp;hellip; well, life.  And my new job at AWS that&amp;rsquo;s kept me busy studying for both the SysOps Admin and Developer certifications.  Those are done now (at least at the Associate level) so I played a bit, as a reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;architecture&#34;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full video pipeline has a producer and a consumer, and perhaps some intermediate processing steps.  In the example I am building I&amp;rsquo;ll have a camera, something that reads an RTSP steam from the camera and writes it to an &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/?amazon-kinesis-video-streams-resources-blog.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;amazon-kinesis-video-streams-resources-blog.sort-order=desc&#34;&gt;Amazon Kinesis Video Stream&lt;/a&gt;.  To read from the stream I&amp;rsquo;ll use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-viewer&#34;&gt;simple web-based solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-the-plugin&#34;&gt;Building the Plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code to start with is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp&#34;&gt;GStreamer plugin&lt;/a&gt;.  The build instructions were confusing so I submitted a Pull Request to make them more clear.  That may be accepted by the time you read this, but if not, here&amp;rsquo;s what you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp.git
mkdir -p amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/build; 
cd amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/build; 
cmake -DBUILD_GSTREAMER_PLUGIN=ON ..
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is ALMOST what was in the docs.  The key part is that you MUST include -DBUILD_GSTREAMER_PLUGIN=ON or it does not build the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run-the-example&#34;&gt;Run the Example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run this you need to have an RTSP camera handy.  I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://store.ui.com/collections/surveillance&#34;&gt;Unifi Camera Product line&lt;/a&gt; and have several.  You will need to find the RTSP URL that applies to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate typing commands over and over, so I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of makefiles.  In the build folder I made a new file called Makefile.run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ACCESS=&amp;#34;&amp;lt;your AWS access key&amp;gt;&amp;#34;
SECRET=&amp;#34;&amp;lt;your AWS secret key&amp;gt;&amp;#34;
REGION=&amp;#34;&amp;lt;your AWS region&amp;gt;&amp;#34;

RTSP =&amp;#34;&amp;lt;your RTSP URL&amp;gt;&amp;#34;

create:
	aws kinesisvideo create-stream --stream-name &amp;#34;MyKVStream&amp;#34; --data-retention-in-hours &amp;#34;24&amp;#34;
	# note this assumes you have setup the AWS CLI already

list:
	 aws kinesisvideo list-streams

kvssink:
	export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=.
    gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=${RTSP} short-header=TRUE ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! video/x-h264, format=avc,alignment=au ! kvssink stream-name=${STREAM} storage-size=512 access-key=${ACCESS} secret-key=${SECRET} aws-region=${REGION}

fake:
	export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=.
	gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=${RTSP} short-header=TRUE ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! video/x-h264, format=avc,alignment=au ! fakesink
		
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-the-stream&#34;&gt;Create the Stream&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should first create the stream (make -f Makefile.run create).  You can verify that it was properly created (make -f Makefile.run list).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;connect-the-camera-feed-to-the-stream&#34;&gt;Connect the Camera Feed to the Stream&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You then connect the feed to the stream (make -f Makefile.run kvssink).  If you get errors you can check your pipeline (make -f Makefile.run fake) using a fake source.  I used that to discover that I needed to add the &amp;lsquo;h264parse&amp;rsquo; to the gstreamer pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;viewing-the-video&#34;&gt;Viewing the Video&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws-samples.github.io/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-media-viewer/&#34;&gt;excellent Kinesis Video Stream Viewer&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s a static web site hosted on GitHub. Fill in the fields with your AWS credentials, region, and your stream name and hit play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps-for-me&#34;&gt;Next Steps for Me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been years since I played with video, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/&#34;&gt;GStreamer&lt;/a&gt; has matured amazingly over that time.  I really need to dig into how it works, what the pipelines really do.  And of course, on the AWS side I need to understand what I can do with the streams there.  I want to plug into &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/?blog-cards.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;blog-cards.sort-order=desc&#34;&gt;Amazon Rekognition&lt;/a&gt; and do some really cool stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AWS SysOps Administrator Certified!</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/sysops-cert-2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jan 2021 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/sysops-cert-2021/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;This week I passed the AWS SysOps Administrator (Associate) Exam.  Here&amp;rsquo;s some notes on what I did to prepare, and observations of the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overall-impression&#34;&gt;Overall Impression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I earned the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/aws-certified/&#34;&gt;AWS Solutions Architect (Associate) certification&lt;/a&gt; but now that I am at AWS I needed to earn another.  I chose the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-sysops-admin-associate/&#34;&gt;SysOps Administrator&lt;/a&gt; because it was the hardest (they say) and because I definitely am an &amp;ldquo;Operations First&amp;rdquo; kind of Engineering leader.  I need to be really strong on these things to help my customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exam covers the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring and Reporting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High Availability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deployment and Provisioning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage and Data Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security and Compliance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Networking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation and Optimization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was strong in networking, VPC, EC2, High Availability from experience and the SA Exam.  I had been much more of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34;&gt;terraform&lt;/a&gt; guy so I had a lot to learn about CloudFormation.  You can expect a lot more blogging from me on that, since I think I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the conclusion that I like CloudFormation better (and not just because I work at AWS now).  More on that later.  I also had a lot to learn about CloudWatch, and especially around cost management.  The last time I obsessed over my AWS spend was at Cognitive Networks back in the 2013-2014 era, and I used a third party tool to watch my spend. &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/&#34;&gt;AWS Budgets&lt;/a&gt; can now alarm and notify you.  And &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/&#34;&gt;AWS Cost Explorer&lt;/a&gt; is what I always wanted when I was signing invoices.  I had to remind myself I was preparing for a test.  I wanted to just play with all these tools!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still wondering what the focus of the test is on let me simplify it for you:  where Solution Architecture is about designing the overall solution, SysOps Administrator is more about how you actually operate it.  Monitoring, troubleshooting, security, permissions, encryption, and super importantly:  managing costs. I think I enjoyed studying for SysOps more than I did for SA, but in truth I love all this stuff so it was all fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SysOps Administrator exam covers a very large scope.  I definitely recommend a structured study program leveraging guides and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;study-guidescourses&#34;&gt;Study Guides/Courses&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain some of my preferences so you can judge if my choices might be of value to you.
My learning style is mostly tactile (learn by doing) but for breadth I like to read a book. I&amp;rsquo;m in the minority here, I know.  Everyone wants video lectures.  I prefer to speed read chapters to get an overview and dive deep where I need to.  I need to do the same with video so I prefer platforms that support playback at 1.5x or 2x speed.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have the patience for 1.0x to be honest.  Books are also tactile for me.  I &amp;ldquo;remember&amp;rdquo; where in the book I read something, and can go back for review.  It&amp;rsquo;s harder for me to do that with videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, I don&amp;rsquo;t like any of the books I found.  I may actually have to write one.  It&amp;rsquo;s completely stupid that there&amp;rsquo;s no good book on Cloud Operations for AWS.  Anyway, I digress.  My strategy was to take a number of practice tests early and map out the areas where I was the weakest.  I opted for this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RCLLTC1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o08?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Practice Tests 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend this book for learning though.  The answers/explanations are too short.  But as a tool to map where I was weakest it was great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For video classes I will sometimes watch on the computer, but my strong preference is to be able to listen to lectures when I work out, especially on the treadmill.  After all, if I&amp;rsquo;m at the keyboard why not just go use the service, read the docs, and learn by doing?  I prefer to use my workout time more efficiently and cover breadth material.  This means that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be fiddling with an interface, clicking to advance to the next topic, or worse, navigating a menu to get to the next topic.  I do appreciate it when the topics are 3-5 minutes long, usually not more than 10.  But if I have to take action to go to the next video that&amp;rsquo;s a deal breaker for me.  &amp;ldquo;Auto-start&amp;rdquo; is my most important feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;video-classes&#34;&gt;Video Classes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite vide class was [CloudGuru](&lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.acloud.guru/course/82f54158-d48b-496c-9f6c-045aa5bdaea8&#34;&gt;https://learn.acloud.guru/course/82f54158-d48b-496c-9f6c-045aa5bdaea8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
/dashboard)  On the web: easy interface, supports 2x (and remembered my setting), and in hindsight had good depth compared to the actual test. No auto-advance.  BUT, get their app.  Much easier, and supports auto-advance. Their practice exam was not enough.  I took it several times and most of the questions repeated, so the question pool was not really big enough.  Plan on using another source for practice tests.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.cantrill.io/p/aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate&#34;&gt;Adrian Cantrill&amp;rsquo;s SysOps course&lt;/a&gt; was well presented and aimed at the new test that&amp;rsquo;s in beta in February.  I found it to be a high quality education and supported 2x, &lt;del&gt;but had no auto-advance&lt;/del&gt; and if you set &amp;ldquo;auto-play&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;auto-complete&amp;rdquo; in settings it does support auto-play (thanks Daniel Comnea for the info on that!).  It&amp;rsquo;s also still in development since that newer exam is not yet available.  I also tried the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-sysops-administrator-associate/&#34;&gt;WhizLabs SysOps Course&lt;/a&gt; and simply cannot recommend it.  The videos auto-advance and support 2x but you have to select the new speed for every video.  I also found the instruction to be weaker.  The practice test questions too obscure and poorly written - and used a lot more &amp;ldquo;trick&amp;rdquo; questions than the real test uses.  It&amp;rsquo;s cheap, but not worth it.  My time is my most precious asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;review-material&#34;&gt;Review Material&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/product/tutorials-dojo-study-guide-ebook-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/&#34;&gt;TutorialsDojo SysOps Study Guide ($7 USD)&lt;/a&gt; was excellent.  For $7 this is a steal - very useful review, the why behind a lot of details - highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really found that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cheat-sheet-aws-certified-sysops-administrator-associate/&#34;&gt;TutorialsDogo SysOps Cheat Sheet (free)&lt;/a&gt; was an excellent section.  Very concise and thorough and easy to recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;practice-tests&#34;&gt;Practice Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[TutorialsDojo Practice Tests](&lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-sysops-admi&#34;&gt;https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-sysops-admi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
nistrator-associate-practice-exams/) were the best practice tests I took.  The difficulty mapped well to what the actual test asked, and the detailed explanations of the answers were well written, concise and easy to recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your results may vary, but these are the resources that worked for me.  Overall I probably spent about 80 hours reviewing (guessing, I did not actually track my time investment).  I did this over about six weeks.  I scored 830/1000 and passing was 720 so I don&amp;rsquo;t think I was over or under-prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people these past weeks about these certifications.  I think they are very valuable for what they are meant to do:  measure if someone has the MINIMUM level of knowledge for that role.  But it&amp;rsquo;s like the driving test at the DMV.  It&amp;rsquo;s not actually DOING it.  The new tests have some practical factors where you have &amp;ldquo;lab-like&amp;rdquo; tasks and I support that a lot.  These certifications are no replacement for actually doing it for real.  Remember there&amp;rsquo;s no compression algorithm for experience!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changes - Ending 2020</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ending-2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ending-2020/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;As 2020 thankfully winds down, I leave Cisco and join AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/aws-logo-300x138.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most of us, I cannot wait to see 2020 in my rear-view mirror.  There is plenty of reason to be hopeful that perhaps, just perhaps, 2021 will be a breakout year that really overcomes so much.  Most of that I have zero influence over - what happens, happens.  One thing I could do though is make a job change.  And I did. After six years I left Cisco and joined Amazon AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without really going into the details it was time.  My new role puts me closer to customers and closer to building real cloud technology.  And Amazon really lives by their &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles&#34;&gt;Leadership Principles&lt;/a&gt;.  No really.  So many friends who have gone to AWS attest to that, and while I&amp;rsquo;ve only been here a few weeks I can tell you it&amp;rsquo;s true.  That was - and is - a huge draw for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what&#34;&gt;What?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what will I be doing?  I&amp;rsquo;ll be managing a team of Solution Architects helping Small and Medium-sized customers in the Western Region.  Our task is to help customers adopt and scale with AWS.  I&amp;rsquo;ll post more about that later, but it&amp;rsquo;s really a simple task:  help customers.  It plays right to all the cloud-beliefs that I hold so dear, and I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to get to do this&amp;hellip; at scale.  You can read my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/aws-certified/&#34;&gt;prior posts for more information on Solution Architecture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expect me to blog more about things I am doing to stay current in AWS tech.  Some of the things I am planning to play around with now include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pine64.org/cube/&#34;&gt;PineCube&lt;/a&gt; to develop robotics and RTSP cameras&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shelly.cloud/products/shelly-1-smart-home-automation-relay/&#34;&gt;Shelly 1 IoT relays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tasmota&#34;&gt;Tasmota Alternative Device firmware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NP5LVFH&#34;&gt;MK5Stack Core 2 IoT Education Kit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://edukit.workshop.aws/en/&#34;&gt;AWS IoT Education Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pine64.org/pinebook-pro/&#34;&gt;PineBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually have all that hardware now, it&amp;rsquo;s just TIME that I could use more of.  I look forward to playing with all this in the context of really, really using all of AWS to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;holiday-wishes-and-2021&#34;&gt;Holiday Wishes, and 2021&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, more than any other year, has reinforced to me how all of us are more alike than it would appear from watching the media.  Don&amp;rsquo;t trust Facebook or social media.  Don&amp;rsquo;t trust the media to convey the actual sentiment of people.  Remember that all of them are selling.  Most often it&amp;rsquo;s you and your eyeballs.  Pick up the phone and call your friends.  COVID has isolated us even more than politics has.  Bridge those gaps.  And when the vaccine is available let&amp;rsquo;s all get together and talk more.  First about our kids.  Our hopes.  Our dreams.  We all want the same things.  Maybe we can all work TOGETHER to make some of them true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish all of you a wonderful Holiday Season and may 2021 bring us all health and prosperity - and a lot of love.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s back to the future again.  Fidding with node.js a lot, but you know, C is still my favorite language.  Dug up some old code to read/write from a serial port.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Power Costs</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/power/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Nov 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A quick measure of the costs of running on-premise computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of my application of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&amp;wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc&#34;&gt;AWS Well Architected Framework&lt;/a&gt; to my own infrastructure I&amp;rsquo;ve been digging into costs a bit.  I have run home servers for years.  A LOT of years.  It&amp;rsquo;s basically tied to my identity.  Of COURSE I have some linux servers at home.  Geesh, who do you think I am?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a bit dumb actually.  This week I got my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0777H8MS8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;new watt meter&lt;/a&gt; and took some measurements.  The server I used for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/gonetmon&#34;&gt;monitoring my network&lt;/a&gt; and syslog aggregation used about 80W.  The server I had been using for DHCP and DNS used about 75W.  I replaced DHCP/DNS with a small solid state machine that only uses 15W.  I also am using that for syslog aggregation and am &lt;a href=&#34;https://gherlein.github.io/post/ubuntu-on-prem-cloudwatch/&#34;&gt;sending the logs off to AWS CloudWatch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in California, and that means PG&amp;amp;E is my energy provider.  I have a tiered cost structure with the first 500 kWh costing $0.15/kWh and the next 500 costing $0.20/kWh.  The last year I&amp;rsquo;ve averaged 641 kWh each month - putting me into tier 2 for some of it.  The two servers accounted for 110 kWh of that - a very surprising 17%.  If I had only known I&amp;rsquo;d have dumped them a long time ago.  They were costing me around $22 per month, on average.  That&amp;rsquo;s stupid.  EC2 instances would not have cost me anywhere near that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net net:  making these changes is not only enabling better tooling, it&amp;rsquo;s going to save me money.  I don&amp;rsquo;t have cost estimates on the AWS side (CloudWatch at least) yet but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to see how I&amp;rsquo;d spend $22 per month.   $4 maybe.  Not $22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to double check my numbers but this is surprising.  It&amp;rsquo;s dumb to consume what you don&amp;rsquo;t really need, and it&amp;rsquo;s dumb to toss money down the drain.  I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did this exercise.  My self-identity as a linux-geek and running my own servers in my house are not worth $22 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data.  Make decisions from data.  Not from emotion.  At least not about money!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using CloudWatch for On-Premise Ubuntu Servers</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-on-prem-cloudwatch/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Nov 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-on-prem-cloudwatch/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Can I replace a local Prometheus with AWS CloudWatch?  And include syslog monitoring as well?  Yes, I can.  But it was a PITA to set up.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-cloudwatch&#34;&gt;Why CloudWatch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn, of course!  Well, that and a practical test.  It&amp;rsquo;s an experiment.  I&amp;rsquo;ve run a local server for years and had it be my syslog server and handle my monitoring.  Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m a geek.  I use Ubiquity Unifi equipment and I have the controller configured to remote syslog so I get all the AP events.  I also run my own internal DHCP for static mapping of MAC to IP, and internal DNS and Reverse DNS.  I used to have DHCP/DNS on a different small server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But running these servers costs me money, in electrical costs.  I decided to see if could get comparable or better functionality using CloudWatch, and then compare the costs too.  This post will be just about the first steps of setting things up.  Later I&amp;rsquo;ll blog about more details on the service, and evaluate the costs.  At this point even if it&amp;rsquo;s more money I&amp;rsquo;m going through this exercise, since I really want to understand how this would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, to really evaluate the two options I&amp;rsquo;ll apply the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/&#34;&gt;5 pillars of the Well Architected Framework&lt;/a&gt; - CORPS in short (Cost, Operational Excellence, Reliability, Performance, Security).  But that&amp;rsquo;s another blog post.  Today is just getting the agent set up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cloudwatch-agent&#34;&gt;CloudWatch Agent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would think this is an easy slam dunk.  AWS has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/install-CloudWatch-Agent-on-premise.html&#34;&gt;document describing how to do this&lt;/a&gt;.  But while it says you can download it using SystemManager or an S3 link, the docs don&amp;rsquo;t actually include a link.  And it&amp;rsquo;s very much written from the perspective that you will use SystemManager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not.  All I want to do is install the Agent locally, configure it, and have it send it&amp;rsquo;s logs and metrics off to CloudWatch.  Turns out that was fraught with difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google searches mostly turned up more on how to do it with SystemManager, or how to do it on an EC2 instance.  I did find &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.petefreitag.com/item/868.cfm&#34;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; that was groundbreaking for me.  But it had some errors and misses too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [agent debian package ](&lt;a href=&#34;https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent&#34;&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
/debian/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb) is installed the usual way.  I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/cloudwatch-install/blob/master/install.sh&#34;&gt;created a script to do most of it for you&lt;/a&gt; but here&amp;rsquo;s the steps.  You need to be root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# run this as root&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# download it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;curl -o /root/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazoncloudwatch-agent&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/debian/amd64/latest/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# install it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;dpkg -i -E /root/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will create a user &amp;ldquo;cwagent&amp;rdquo; but does nothing to configure anything.  You next do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# add the cwagent user to the adm group so it can read logs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;usermod -aG adm cwagent
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# configure the user credentials&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cat &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF &amp;gt; /home/cwagent/.aws/credentials
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;[AmazonCloudWatchAgent]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;aws_access_key_id = aaaaaaaa
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;aws_secret_access_key = bbbbbbbb
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# configure the user region&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cat &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOF &amp;gt; /home/cwagent/.aws/config
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;[AmazonCloudWatchAgent]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;output = text
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;region = us-east-1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;EOF&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# get your own IAM creds for an IAM user and edit the file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;nano /home/cwagent/.aws/credentials
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# set ownership&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;chmod -R cwagent.cwagent /home/cwagent
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward requires two things:  you need to &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html&#34;&gt;install the AWS CLI&lt;/a&gt; on your Ubuntu server, and you need to create an IAM user &amp;ldquo;cwagent.&amp;rdquo;  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-iam-roles-for-cloudwatch-agent.html&#34;&gt;AWS docs for the latter&lt;/a&gt; are quite clear and easy to follow.  When you have the AWS credentials for the new user, you need to add those to the new user on your ubuntu server:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# get your own IAM creds for an IAM user and edit the file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;nano /home/cwagent/.aws/credentials
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace nano with your favorite editor, as desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, set the region you want as well.  The example uses us-east-1 but choose the right region for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you also need to chown the files, since you did all this editing as root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# set ownership&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;chmod -R cwagent.cwagent /home/cwagent
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this next step is important.  If you don&amp;rsquo;t have collectd installed and you configure to collect metrics (see below) then the agent will just hang and not do anything.  Not even send syslogs.  I need to test this to ensure I can reproduce it, but it seems like a bug.  The logs should at least say something about it but they don&amp;rsquo;t.  More on the agent logs later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;configuration&#34;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I had a lot of head scratching.  The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/create-cloudwatch-agent-configuration-file-wizard.html&#34;&gt;documentation from AWS&lt;/a&gt; is flat oout WRONG.  I have submitted feedback to the page on what I found.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the scoop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# run the wizard&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/amazon-cloudwatch-agent-config-wizard
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# move the configuration file to the right place and name it properly&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mv /opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/bin/config.json &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;\ &lt;/span&gt;/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/etc/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.json
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running the wizard asks you a set of questions and creates a config file.  However you need to move it to the etc folder and rename it in order for the agent to be able to find it.  The docs on the sections of the file seem pretty accurate, and it&amp;rsquo;s self explanatory really.  I just accepted defaults, except for specifying the actual syslog file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, make sure you installed collectd.  Otherwise, the agent just hangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you are ready.  Restart the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# restart the service&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;service amazon-cloudwatch-agent restart
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# check status&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;service amazon-cloudwatch-agent	status
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# check the logs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;tail -f /var/log/amazon/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020-11-04T14:26:44Z I!

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020-11-04T14:26:44Z I! &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;inputs.socket_listener&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; Listening on udp://127.0.0.1:25826
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020-11-04T14:26:44Z I! Statsd listener listening on:  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;::&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;:8125
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020-11-04T14:26:45Z I! will use file based credentials provider
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;2020-11-04T14:26:45Z I! &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;logagent&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; piping log from syslog/sol1&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;/var/log/messages&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; to cloudwatchlogs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you know that the agent is sending stuff to CloudWatch.  Your next step is to go there and configure dashboards, etc.  That&amp;rsquo;s for another post!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Disposability - the Missing ility</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/disposability/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/disposability/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;You will get the most bang for the buck from cloud by destroying it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bold-statement&#34;&gt;Bold Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right:  you will get the most bang for the buck from cloud by destroying it.  Disposability may be the most important of the &amp;ldquo;ilities&amp;rdquo; if you care about your overall development velocity.  I talk about this a little bit in my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;Cloudy DevOps&lt;/a&gt; post but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I hammered the point well enough.  Certainly not in my day job, where I found out this week that we are living with pain around that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-disposability&#34;&gt;What is Disposability?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply put:  the ability to easily completely destroy a set of cloud resources you have deployed - and then automatically recreate them again.  We focus so much on the automation of the CREATION but disposability is all about being able to easily destroy it again.  In AWS you can do this with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/&#34;&gt;CloudFormation&lt;/a&gt; using Stacks and StackSets.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; is a similar tool and is my preferred solution.  But regardless of the tool you use, the automation of the creation and descruction is a core cloud best practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s funny, actually, to talk about &amp;ldquo;serverless&amp;rdquo; since it&amp;rsquo;s the epitomy of disposability.  Consider AWS &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/&#34;&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt; for example.  You literally set certain code to execute on a certain event and the compute resources are created, run your code, and disposed of when done.  Serverless embodies disposabililty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefit-to-velocity---decouple&#34;&gt;Benefit to Velocity - Decouple!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand that cost control is a huge benefit.  Teams can spin up cloud resources and when they are done with them, perhaps for the day, they can dispose of them.  You don&amp;rsquo;t get charged for resources that no longer exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the biggest benefits may come from a net increase in development velocity.  If you can deploy and destroy atomic units of your solution automatically then the team responsible for that unit can work independently.  They can build and test that unit with no dependency on any other team.  More importantly, the other services that they depend on can likewise be deployed BY THAT TEAM in a development environment for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example, only slightly contrived:  you have three teams.  One is the front-end browser app, one is the application software team, and one handles the database and the ingesting and indexing of the data.  The front-end team are already used to a model where they can get a clean runtime environment merely by closing a tab.  The app team, however, can get substantial value from treating the entire data layer as a disposable object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you can run a script that instantiates the whole data layer automatically, and by passing in a parameter the script can populate the database to a known state (last production backup, clone of a running system, or load of a specific test dataset, whatever).  The App team can spin up a database, run a set of tests against their code, and then just destroy that database.  They can also automate this and use a set of tests against a specific set of known database states.  That too is a best practice, as part of a CI/CD pipeline.  But if you cannot easily dispose of the resources and then re-create them, none of this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your teams can do this, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to maintain a &amp;ldquo;staging&amp;rdquo; environment.  You can create one on demand.  You don&amp;rsquo;t need to have teams bottle-necked waiting for a certain database load to be restored by the Ops team for testing, or for a newer version of another micro-service to be deployed so you can test your implementation of their new API version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is literally decoupling the development process the way that micro-services decouple system design.  Monolithic software systems can bog down from one poorly implemented part.  We decouple our code to solve that.  We should also decouple our development processes, and Disposability is the key way to enable that.  This is a concrete example of &amp;ldquo;thinking like a Software Engineer&amp;rdquo; - only applied to your overall workflows not just to your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accidental-gravity-wells&#34;&gt;Accidental Gravity Wells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My day job fell into a gravity well around all this, totally accidentally.  We are giant believers in the &amp;ldquo;Infrastructure as Code&amp;rdquo; approach, and we keep our terraform scripts in github.  We also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt&#34;&gt;Terragrunt&lt;/a&gt; to help us keep our code DRY and help us modulularize our code.  We enforce a code review process so that changes cannot be merged without a successful approval.  We isolate the humans from the running of the code using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.runatlantis.io/&#34;&gt;Atlantis&lt;/a&gt;.  This operational discipline is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But.  There&amp;rsquo;s almost always a but.  Atlantis is great for production, but for development it adds a wrinkle.  Atlantis manages the terraform state, so the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to dispose of what it created (to do a &amp;ldquo;terraform destroy&amp;rdquo;) also requires a pull request and a code review.  The change to the scripts is only one line, but then the code repo master branch has that one line change.  I guess this is not a bad thing since master then reflects the actual state of the infra.  But it just feels wrong.  It&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as it seems like it should be. If we were simply using raw terraform in a main.tf it would be a lot easier, but we do a lot of custom modules and wrap it in terragrunt.  So it&amp;rsquo;s less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that matters, since it looks like making it harder to dispose of cloud resources resulted in teams not actually disposing of things - leading to not decoupling the processes.  When you are transforming a development organization to agile, cloud processes you can&amp;rsquo;t make it harder.  Then teams just fall into the gravity well of doing things the way they always have.  And that&amp;rsquo;s really hard to spot unless you are in the trenches with the teams.  You may not even see it in your cloud costs.  It will show up later in slower overall velocity.  And that&amp;rsquo;s bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just moving your infra to cloud is what I call &amp;ldquo;Cloud 1.0&amp;rdquo; and if that&amp;rsquo;s all you do that&amp;rsquo;s great.  But if you really want to get the actual benefits of cloud then embrace Disposability.  There&amp;rsquo;s a learning curve and some up front investment, but it will pay off downstream in vastly improved development velocity as well as product quality.  And it then enables you to do work on all the other &amp;lsquo;ilities&amp;quot; too.  And in the principle of &amp;ldquo;thinking like a Software Engineer&amp;rdquo; none of this is &amp;ldquo;done done&amp;rdquo; unless it&amp;rsquo;s been tested.  And that means creating and destroying in at least a few accounts and ensuring you haven&amp;rsquo;t left any orphaned resources behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you are jumping past VM and k8s deployments towards serverless you are already doing disposability anyway.  That&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So go take a peek at your systems.  Are you missing Disposability?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GitHub Actions - Copy to S3 on Commit to Master</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/github-to-s3/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/github-to-s3/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;GitHub Actions can be for more than CI/CD.  You can also use them to just simply publish to S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;github-actions&#34;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub can trigger actions on events.  This is what drives CI/CD integrations.  But it can be used for things that are radically simpler too.  I found myself wanting to automatically push changes to a CloudFormation (CF) template to an S3 bucket, since that&amp;rsquo;s where CF wants to pull templates from.  But, as a software guy, I beleive in my soul of souls that everything is code, and code needs to be in source control - which means GitHub, for all practical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;secrets&#34;&gt;Secrets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, you need to go into your repo settings and store your secrets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/secrets.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically you need to set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and if you want to just copy and paste from my main.yaml file you should set AWS_REGION.  This is exactly the stuff from configuring AWS CLI tools.  That&amp;rsquo;s the action you will be taking:  using AWS CLI to sync files to an S3 bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;actions&#34;&gt;Actions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your repo, you need to make a folder that tells GitHub what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir -p .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/main.yaml
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In your favorite text editor, open .github/workflows/main.yaml and paste the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;name: CopyToS3
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Configure AWS Credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
        aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
    - name: Copy Templates
      run: aws s3 sync . s3://&amp;lt;your-bucket-name&amp;gt; --delete
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can go peek at my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/cf-templates/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml&#34;&gt;working example&lt;/a&gt; for my bucket in S3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is so trivial and simple, but I had to go find a simple example because all the examples that are easily found are for much more complicated CI/CD behavior.  I do owe a shout-out to a great example I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.kylegalbraith.com/2019/12/09/deploying-your-static-websites-to-aws-in-style-using-github-actions/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for publishing a static web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps someone!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Golang Unikernel Is Reality!</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:01 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/golang-enabled-microkernel-reality/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Back in January of 2018 I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/golang-enabling-unikernels-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;blogged on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; asking the question if golang would enable development of micro-kernels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I saw that someone has posted exactly that: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/icexin/eggos&#34;&gt;EggOS&lt;/a&gt;.  I am excited to play with it, and especially if you can couple that to &lt;a href=&#34;https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/&#34;&gt;AWS Firecracker&lt;/a&gt;. Firecracker is a service that allows you to &amp;ldquo;launch lightweight micro-virtual machines (microVMs) in non-virtualized environments in a fraction of a second.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s open source, developed by AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can potentially RADICALLY change how micro-services-on-demand can be delivered.  More to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building Solution Architecture Teams - A Software Approach</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/sa-team-software-approach/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/sa-team-software-approach/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;What actually is Solution Architecture?  How do you build and manage an Architecture team?  Can you take a software approach to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;solution-architecture---some-background&#34;&gt;Solution Architecture - Some Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of what I have done these past ten years is a mix of Software Engineering and Cloud System Engineering: in other words, Solution Architecture (SA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s cloud software is based on the concepts of distributed systems: smaller, atomic units that communicate with each other over the network.  They either accept data as an input and return some answer, or accept a request for data that returns some answer.  What happens in the middle is either some process on the data or some process on stored data.  That&amp;rsquo;s a vast oversimplification, of course.  But it&amp;rsquo;s directionally accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often call the software modules &amp;ldquo;micro-services&amp;rdquo; and a working solution to a problem is a collection of such services. You can be a pure Software Engineer and only work on one small service, but if you are more senior you are almost certainly designing how a set of services interact.  One of the goals of micro-services architecture is to decompose a large problem into a smaller problems each solved with a service.  The Engineers that do that work are doing the job of a Solutions Architect. Now, that can be at both the platform/infrastructure level and/or the application level.  You might be creating scripts to build out your whole infra-environment, or writing system code to process data, or GUI code that actually runs in a users browser.  But it&amp;rsquo;s all basically nodes in a system that &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; to other nodes to do stuff.  All of it requires software development.  And I have &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/sre-123/&#34;&gt;strong opinions on that&lt;/a&gt;.  But it also requires System Design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, Solution Architecture is the intersection of Systems and Software Engineering.  A given SA may be skewed more towards Systems Engineering (perhaps more customer-engaged) or more towards Software Engineering (more of a coder) but the role of Solution Architecture lives in the common area of that venn diagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/sa-venn-diagram.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s well worth pointing out that good Solutions Architecture is good Software Design.  Think &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID&#34;&gt;SOLID&lt;/a&gt; in everything you do. The difference between a system that is highly reliable, secure, and operable and one that is breaking, getting hacked, and makes some on your Ops team quit after each outage is whether you have good architecture.  And in today&amp;rsquo;s world, it&amp;rsquo;s all software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I could opine that topic but I won&amp;rsquo;t.  AWS has written the book on that:  the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/the-5-pillars-of-the-aws-well-architected-framework/&#34;&gt;AWS Well Architected Framework&lt;/a&gt;.  Go read it.  Seriously.  If you are building software in the cloud you NEED to know this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution Architects not only need to know it, they need to be able to explain it.  This means becoming good at presentations, teaching, explaining, and even showing others how to do it.  There&amp;rsquo;s a people-facing part to the job that is a whole new dimension to the computer-facing part of the job that most Engineers are already comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;climbing-up-5000-feet&#34;&gt;Climbing Up 5000 Feet&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this post is not about Solutions Architecture, per se.  It&amp;rsquo;s about building and managing TEAMS of SA.  One can recruit and hire one team fairly easily.  If you are staying true to the &amp;ldquo;two-pizza team&amp;rdquo; notion then you probably are looking at 7-9 folks.  Given money, reputation and access to the right people-networks you can hire that many Engineers and seed a fantastic team.  But over time attrition (good and bad) will leak folks away.  More on that later.  And what if you don&amp;rsquo;t have the money to woo the top talent to your team?  What if you need more than one team?  What if you are scaling your systems so fast that you know you are going to need to scale more teams over time?  There&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;rice-a-roni&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;hamburger helper&amp;rdquo; for that meal.  You need a real solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This calls for a process - something repeatable.  Measurable.  Replicable.  Something that does not &amp;ldquo;rely on the heroics of individuals&amp;rdquo; but instead can be manufactured. You want a factory that turns out great Solution Architects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/factory_floor.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone once told me that the role of management is to get things to a place where you can run the company with only mediocre staff.  I don&amp;rsquo;t agree.  I still think you should hire and develop the best talent you can find.  But the idea behind that statement is solid.  Don&amp;rsquo;t base your success on whether you are lucky enough to hire all 10x Engineers.  We could argue whether there is such a thing as a 10x Engineer.  I can certainly argue that there is absolutely such a thing as a 0.1x Engineer.  You can also have fractured processes that can cripple even the best teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You do need good Engineering Management. &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/eng-leadership-321/&#34;&gt;I have written about that already&lt;/a&gt;.  You also need solid software Development practices (code reviews, automated testing, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;Cloudy DevOps&lt;/a&gt;, etc.).  That&amp;rsquo;s all basic block and tackle for the task.  But what you need is a process to find motivated, fundamentally strong Engineers with the right attitude - and then you need a process to mold them, over time, into what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like building a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BA5776/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&#34;&gt;Leadership Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; for your management teams, you need to think about building a Solution Architect Pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004BA5776/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/leader-pipeline-book.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;taking-a-software-approach&#34;&gt;Taking a Software Approach&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data pipelines are a standard solution pattern for some kinds of problems.  Our need for SA talent maps to this pattern pretty well, if you think about it in software terms.  You need to recruit, train on your solution, and then mentor and grow Engineers.  Yes, they are people.  But if you think about this as a process you can apply Engineering thinking to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you read my posts you know that I&amp;rsquo;m generally in favor of taking a software approach to solving problems - the so-called &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/sre-123/&#34;&gt;SRE solution&lt;/a&gt;.  This means THINKING like a Software Engineer at a very minimum.  If we could write code to automate all the work that Solution Archtects do that would be great!  Wait&amp;hellip;  to some extent that is already happening, with things like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool&#34;&gt;AWS Well Architected Tool&lt;/a&gt;.  ML/AI is going to have a huge impact on Solution Architecture, even sooner than you think.  But in the meantime, we need to build teams of Solution Architects and a pipeline approach seems to be appropriate.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how I would lay out the pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/pipeline.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think about this as if each team were a kanban board with those four columns, and each team member is a row.  In this model, the &amp;ldquo;work items&amp;rdquo; are actually the SA Engineers themselves.  The columns are defined in reverse order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;promote&#34;&gt;Promote&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term is the one I still struggle with.  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure &amp;ldquo;promote&amp;rdquo; is the right word for this, but I cannot think of a better one yet.  These Engineers have been &amp;ldquo;in the trenches&amp;rdquo; on the team &amp;ldquo;maturing&amp;rdquo; in their abilities.  They have extensive hands-on experience and are seen as the technical leaders.  Other SA seek them out.  They probably are conducting training, both internally and externally.  They are inventing solutions to problems, developing advanced new software, perhaps even getting patents.  In the guild days these would be the Masters.  They are the rock-stars that can be parachuted into a mystery problem and they solve it quickly.  They are the dragon-slayers.  Teams should aspire to have one or two, but not count on them.  Their next step is to move on to a larger challenge.  Often these kind of folks form the nucleus of a new product team or move into some other role where they can keep learning and growing.  You must assume that they will rotate away at some point (even as you selfishly hope they never do).  They need to, for their own growth. But these are the folks you are actively &amp;ldquo;promoting&amp;rdquo; to customers, other teams, and internally as the expert.  And yes, it often follows that these are the folks that get promoted to ranks like &amp;ldquo;Principal Engineer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mature&#34;&gt;Mature&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where most of a team will be if it&amp;rsquo;s firing on all cylinders.  Not all the team will be at the same level of maturity, but perhaps 60% of your team should be maturing.  These folks are well trained, know their jobs, and execute. In the guild days they would be the journeymen/women.  SA may stay in this zone for quite some time, depending.  This is the wheelhouse.  The folks in this zone are delivering value, and it&amp;rsquo;s the managers job to ensure that they are mentored, coached and constantly growing.  A smart manager will use their &amp;ldquo;Promote&amp;rdquo; folks to help here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;train&#34;&gt;Train&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My observation is that a newly hired Engineer - no matter how strong - takes a few months on average before they are actually delivering value.  I call this the &amp;ldquo;training zone&amp;rdquo; for lack of a better term.  This may be training on processes, on low-level details of the code base, on the tech-stack in use, the cloud provider details, or whatever.  Every situation has it&amp;rsquo;s particulars.  Sometimes you totally luck out and it takes a lot less time, but if you plan on it taking some time you are going to be a lot more predictable about how much value your team can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When writing software, if you sit down and code without thinking about the problem you can LOOK productive and be totally wasting your time.  Being in the training zone is a lot like that.  Unless you plan and structure your training process you will get ad-hoc results.  Setting up training for your SA Engineers is worth a whole post on it&amp;rsquo;s own, but it needs to include a structured review of your architecture, the structure of the code, how to build and test as a developer, how your CI and CD works, and a review of your automated testing.  This includes getting access to all the tools, and ensure that everyone understands how to use the tools (and why).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;recruit&#34;&gt;Recruit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is controversial. Some teams only recruit when they actually get an open position approved, but that makes you totally flat footed when you start recruiting.  In my experience, it takes two to four months on average from listing a position to someone&amp;rsquo;s first day (&amp;ldquo;but in seat&amp;rdquo;, as I say).  This can be longer if you are seeking a more specialized skill set or competition for that talent is high.  This is also assuming that you can be competitive for talent in some way (great pay, benefits, work from home, reputation).  If you can&amp;rsquo;t then it&amp;rsquo;s going to take you longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer the &amp;ldquo;always be recruiting&amp;rdquo; model.  This means that I am constantly looking, and I&amp;rsquo;m honest with everyone about my ability to make an offer.  I&amp;rsquo;d rather go to my VP and beg for a req because I have someone amazing ready to change jobs than not even know that person was ever looking because I&amp;rsquo;m not paying attention.  Yes, this takes time and energy.  Yes, this means watching forums, github projects, and listening to new speakers at conferences.  You want to find the best?  You have to look.  You cannot assume that your recruiters will magically just find the top talent for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overlap&#34;&gt;Overlap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that it&amp;rsquo;s not really a pipeline.  It too is a venn diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/pipeline-venn.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can recruit folks with more of the specific skills you need, reducing the needed training - perhaps Certified Solution Architect, or CKA.  You can put folks in training doing real work, starting to mature.  Your folks maturing are probably deepening in areas that you will want to promote them around.  The pipeline idea is close, but reality is more fuzzy.  It&amp;rsquo;s really a blend.  We are talking about humans, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;atrition&#34;&gt;Atrition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will get attrition.  Don&amp;rsquo;t fear it, embrace it.  In Cloudy thinking you assume a VM or container can evaporate and you design around that.  Treat attrition the same way.  Plan to replace folks.  This is not mean or inhuman.  Of course you want to keep teams together as long as you can.  Teams are composed of groups of people who trust each other.  Trust takes time and work.  Losing a team member can hurt.  But it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen.  You actually want your Promote folks to move on to more challenging projects for their own career development.  But you also may lose folks in the Mature zone who get excited about a different technology or even leave for a different company.  Too many managers assume they won&amp;rsquo;t lose staff.  That&amp;rsquo;s just like assuming a server will never fail.  And we know how that works out.  Plan to lose people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-kanban-thinking&#34;&gt;Using Kanban Thinking&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple kanban board with these columns - which could be a spreadsheet, actually - lets you see where you are at with a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/even-team.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a well balanced team.  You have a rock star being groomed for the next big adventure, a solid team, some folks in training and some folks you have your eyes on for recruiting.  This is something close to what you aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you inherited a team, or are forming a new team by seeding it with a few strong, mature Engineers then it might look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/likely-team.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This team is relying on three folks to carry the load, and you have four folks in training.  You don&amp;rsquo;t have a rock star to lean on, so the manager is hopefully jumping in to help.  But he or she really should be making sure the four in training are progressing along nicely.  This is a team that may not be struggling, but they have some work to do in order to be a high performance team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;but-what-about-multiple-teams--how-to-scale&#34;&gt;But What About Multiple Teams?  How to Scale?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can manage one team.  How do you do multiple teams?  How do you even know where you are?  You still use kanban.  Consider this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/many-teams.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orange team has a minor problem: they have four SA training and only three to carry the workload.  This team could be risking burnout or potentially under-delivering to the customer.  There&amp;rsquo;s hope on the horizon though, since there&amp;rsquo;s four SA training.  The Green team might be the highest performing team of the bunch with two SA in the Promote region.  That&amp;rsquo;s a heavy hitting team.  But there&amp;rsquo;s a potential risk lurking: there&amp;rsquo;s no one training yet.  Good news is that there&amp;rsquo;s a pipeline of eight Engineers being recruited, so there&amp;rsquo;s a path to healthy. The easiest risk to miss is the Yellow.  They look fine, at a glance, but there&amp;rsquo;s no one in the recruiting pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion-for-now&#34;&gt;Conclusion (For Now)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no right answer:  only data and the actions you take as a result of the data.  This approach gives you some of that data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the zones deserves it&amp;rsquo;s own deep dive.  I&amp;rsquo;ll do those in follow-on posts.  But thinking of the problem in software terms - specifically using kanban (which is not just for software, I know) can really help you structure your thinking about this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The astute reader might point out that this approach could work for general software development teams too.  In fact, if you add a Z-axis for skill set mapping you&amp;rsquo;ve basically got my approach to staffing.  That&amp;rsquo;s fodder for a whole series of additional posts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, this post assumes a little bit that your problem space can be solved by adding Solution Architects.  At some point of scaling that does not hold true.  Better approaches are needed, which will include automation - and maybe some of that ML/AI that I alluded to in my introduction.  The future will be full of innovation and advancement.  It&amp;rsquo;s not going to get boring any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac and Chrome HotKeys</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/hotkeys/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 17 Oct 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/hotkeys/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A simple hotkey extension in Chrome that makes my life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a Mac as my regular desktop.  I do use a Linux Desktop for some things, and I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/hello-ubuntu-kinda/&#34;&gt;written about that before&lt;/a&gt;.  But my daily work machine is a Mac Book Pro - one of the newer 2020 16&amp;quot; models that actually has a real keyboard again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use virtual desktops and I have a scheme.  Outlook stuff on desk 1, Chrome on 2, main working App on 3, etc.  Usually some kind of monitoring app on 4.  I use dual monitors too, and my IM apps are all on my left monitor.  Whatever.  That&amp;rsquo;s just how I do it.  I use the great &lt;a href=&#34;https://cordlessdog.com/stay/&#34;&gt;Stay&lt;/a&gt; app to keep things where I want them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the day I am constantly flipping back and forth in virtual desktops using &amp;ldquo;Ctrl-left-or-right-arrow&amp;rdquo; to change desktops.  If you saw my open Chrome you would see that I have a LOT of tabs open.  A lot.  Probably 30.  Some things I am actively using, some I will get back to, some I actually forgot I had them open.  This morning I have a set I am using to learn about &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/latest/dg/what-is-robomaker.html&#34;&gt;AWS Robomaker&lt;/a&gt; including some workshop pages as well as the actual AWS console pages (several of those).  It&amp;rsquo;s really annoying to not be able to easily change browser tabs as easily as I can change virtual desktops&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switch-tabs-shortcuts/fejclhnofpjonlkijaekjpoehpinhlab&#34;&gt;Install this Chrome Extension&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&#34;chrome://extensions/shortcuts&#34;&gt;pick your hot keys &lt;/a&gt;.  I have mine set to go left and right tab with &amp;ldquo;Ctrl-Shift-left-or-right-arrow&amp;rdquo; so that it&amp;rsquo;s minimal difference for my fingers on the keyboard.  Your choice may differ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is a seemingly minor but wonderfully amazing little hack that makes me more efficient and happy.  Maybe it can help you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>iTerm2 Paste Buffers on MacOS/OSX - how to increase size</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/iterm2-paste/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Quick reminder: how to increase the copy-paste buffers size in iTerm2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was taking some SQL statements that had been sent to me in a spreadsheet (don&amp;rsquo;t ask) and pasting them into their own files so I could check them into git.  Some of the table create statements were REALLY big (again, don&amp;rsquo;t ask).  For many of them I could only paste the first part&amp;hellip;  which at first I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand.  I thought maybe there was some control code in the text that was getting read by the terminal.  I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out there is a relatively small buffer by default, and it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to increase it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 QuickPasteBytesPerCall -int 4096
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2 QuickPasteDelayBetweenCalls -float 0.01
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credits to these two posts:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SRE 123</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/sre-123/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2020 14:50:08 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Everyone is all on fire about SRE.  But what is it really?  It&amp;rsquo;s as easy as 1-2-3 if you boil it down to the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sre+book&amp;qid=1601526038&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/sre-book.jpg&#34; width=&#34;50%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have &lt;a href=&#34;https://smile.amazon.com/Site-Reliability-Engineering-Production-Systems/dp/149192912X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=sre+book&amp;qid=1601526038&amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;read the book&lt;/a&gt; right?  If not, go read it.  I&amp;rsquo;ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Site Reliabillity Engineering (SRE) means a lot of things to a lot of people.  You may have read my post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-devops-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;How To Do DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.  You also may have read my thoughts on &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/&#34;&gt;Cloudy DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.  SRE is not all that different.   It&amp;rsquo;s DevOps through a different lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/lens.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it&amp;rsquo;s a lens that distinctly SOFTWARE ENGINEERING.  Yes, I did just yell that.  I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to so many folks in the last 18 months who want to ride the buzzword wave and say they are doing SRE.  Everything from dashboards to CI/CD to monitoring tools to alerting systems.  It&amp;rsquo;s funny, in a way. And it&amp;rsquo;s fine to call it SRE, I guess.  It&amp;rsquo;s still a free country.  But I don&amp;rsquo;t think it really is SRE unless it&amp;rsquo;s intrinsically about building software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally SRE is the practice of applying Software Engineering to Operations problems.  That&amp;rsquo;s also why it&amp;rsquo;s DevOps.  My rules of DevOps anyway (see my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-devops-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;post referred above&lt;/a&gt;).  Is writing terraform scripts SRE?  Maybe.  If it&amp;rsquo;s just automating deployment it&amp;rsquo;s in the grey zone.  If it&amp;rsquo;s part of automating the entire development process then hell yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why my team - that often spend most of their time really doing Site Reliability Engineering - get angry if you call them SRE.  They will tell you &amp;ldquo;NO!  We are Software Engineers.&amp;rdquo;  And they are right.  In my opinion, if you are not writing software you are not doing SRE work.  You might be an architect, and improving a system&amp;rsquo;s reliability, uptime, operability, sustainability, performance, whatever&amp;hellip; but taking Operations into account should be part of your job.  You can&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;be an SRE.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s a verb, not a noun.  You &amp;ldquo;do SRE&amp;rdquo; and when you do that you are writing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is STILL the part I keep seeing that gets missed, and STILL the part that is the hardest.  Automating your cloud deployment only for deploying production is Cloud 1.0 thinking.  That&amp;rsquo;s table stakes today.  If you think you want to do SRE then you need to be automating the deployment of ALL your software even in dev and test.  You need to be deploying your whole system to run tests and then kill the whole thing.  SRE is about building software, not just automating operations.  And then it&amp;rsquo;s about building things into your software that make it work better, faster, more reliably, and enable faster recovery for WHEN (not if) something goes wrong.  SRE is not just directly in support of Operations though.  It can be 100% about building tools, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; is a direct child of real SRE.  It&amp;rsquo;s what happens when Software Engineers decided that they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to manage live systems when software could do it better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://prometheus.io/&#34;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; is a direct child of real SRE because it provides a real way to collect, track, and alert on metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://opentelemetry.io/&#34;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt; is a direct child of real SRE because it provides a real way to measure, track and alert on latencies and traces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people working on those products are doing SRE.  Are they &amp;ldquo;an SRE?&amp;rdquo;  No.  SRE is Software Engineering.  It&amp;rsquo;s writing code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But do you have to be building tools to do SRE?  Absolutly not.  It may be writing something that supports automatic database replication to a second (or third) cloud region, or building circuit breaker proxies to limit blast radius of a cascading failure, or refactoring connection code libraries to support failover connections&amp;hellip; or whatever.  All of those are SRE work.  What makes it SRE work is the obscession over operations.  That&amp;rsquo;s why not all Software Engineers are doing work I would call SRE.  If you are building features of the product where the user story is for a non-Operations person then you are probably not doing SRE.  But if you are writing software that enables material improvements in Operations then you are probably doing SRE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely if your company is calling you an SRE and you are automating Ops that&amp;rsquo;s important, critcal work.  You are doing DevOps for sure.  But to me, that&amp;rsquo;s not really SRE.  That&amp;rsquo;s just what DevOps should be doing.  SRE is hard-core Engineering with the same skills as your development team - only elevated, and probably at the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a mature software organization whose developer base is well skilled in the technologies in play it&amp;rsquo;s wise to distribute strong, senior Engineers across the teams to &amp;ldquo;do SRE&amp;rdquo; as they build the product.  If your products - and thus your teams - are making a transition from older technologies then having a centralized SRE team might make sense.  You are unlikely to mature the products and the overall developer skills homogenously.  If you are like most companies, those teams are distributed across the world.  It&amp;rsquo;s unlikely they would each choose similar approaches and tech stacks and if you let that happen you don&amp;rsquo;t get SRE, you get Operations chaos.  Because Operations needs the fewest possible technologies, wired up the simplest way.  SRE is all about one eye on Operations.  In those cases you are probably better off building out a centralized SRE team to enable consistent patterns at least - and to provide a single escalation point for Operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/glasses.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in many ways, SRE is just an evoltion of DevOps, from a certain point of view.  It&amp;rsquo;s just a more comprehensive lens. It&amp;rsquo;s thinking every moment of every day about how the software will run, how it will fail, how it will recover, how it will self-heal, how it will degrade gracefully if it can&amp;rsquo;t heal, how it can be better without waking up a human&amp;hellip; and then designing and building software to solve that.  In many ways, it&amp;rsquo;s the highest calling for people who really care about the craft of writing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least, it is for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;The Blackburn theme for Hugo has a bug in how it shows social media icons.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend David Wang also uses Blackburn and he shared with me his &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dcwangmit01/www.davidwang.com/blob/master/README.md&#34;&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the PR merges into Blackburn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd themes/blackburn/layouts/partials
rm share.html
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn/186f596907bd6ab0c746631bf8b66978b8072eef/layouts/partials/share.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuild.  Worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello Ubuntu - Kinda</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/hello-ubuntu-kinda/</link>

        &lt;p&gt;Debian not good for me on the desktop - back to Ubuntu, lost the snaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/debian-again/&#34;&gt;last post &lt;/a&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d gone back to Debian and had some issues with HDMI.  I finally gave up on those - and a slew of other small usability problems that just made Debian a non-answer for me.  Wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;time&#34;&gt;Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those of you who know me know my favorite saying:  you can always get more money, you can never get back time.  Frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ok-back-to-the-story&#34;&gt;Ok, back to the story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Ubuntu, but with a vengence.  I wrote about how angry the whole snaps thing made me.  I found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kevin-custer.com/blog/disabling-snaps-in-ubuntu-20-04/&#34;&gt;solution to remove them&lt;/a&gt;.  This may be an ephemeral thing, if Cannonical goes all proprietary and starts requiring them for something that you just cannot live without.  But for now, it&amp;rsquo;s a solution to the pain point.  The simplified steps themselves are in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/snap-removal&#34;&gt;shell script here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pains&#34;&gt;Pains&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I still worrry.  And Ubuntu is still not perfect.  I really don&amp;rsquo;t like that I have to spend hours tweaking a new Ubuntu Desktop install.  Which I had to do, several times, trying to get a second monitor working.  I had bought a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00K85XURC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;Diamond USB3 HDMI Adapter&lt;/a&gt; which then required some Diamond Diamond software to be installed and&amp;hellip;  well, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work all that well.  It could be made to work, but it got really wierd if you switched inputs.  It also did not have any DDC plumbed through it so I could not use software commands instead of a real KVM.  I cannot find a dual monitor 4K KVM, and apparently neither can others so I tried to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/haimgel/display-switch&#34;&gt;do this&lt;/a&gt;.  More lost time.  Frustrating.  That&amp;rsquo;s where I learned that monitors don&amp;rsquo;t listen to DDC commands from anything other than the active input. Which makes sense, but trashed my software design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to Ubuntu.  The real kiss of death on the Diamond adapter was the block around the cursor that would not update in real time so there was this 1990s shitty experience of an ugly screen - and then not being able to see the letters you typed at a cursor insertion point when you clicked into a doc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that got returned.  Not a solution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-where-am-i-with-ubuntu&#34;&gt;So where am I with Ubuntu?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have it installed on my notebook.  It&amp;rsquo;s not as painful to install &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-18.04/&#34;&gt;as before &lt;/a&gt; - stuff just works, including the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-lid/&#34;&gt;lid controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m frustrated.  I wish it would just work.  I have other projects I really want to do and I&amp;rsquo;m spending precious hours setting up Ubuntu again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Raspberry Pi Zero W Fun</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/rpi-zero-w/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:01 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/rpi-zero-w/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;The Raspberry Pi Zero W is likely the basis of my next few projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a few things I want to build, and they are sort of coming together a bit.  I want to have a way to plug a small sensor board board (1x2 inches or so) into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T82D4YF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;USB wall wart power supply with vertical power sockets&lt;/a&gt; and have it measure temperature, humidity, and motion and connect over wifi.  And, I want to pick up my ideas for a robotics development platform that is good for both teaching and actual small robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sensor-board&#34;&gt;Sensor Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sensor board is just a way to remotely measure the conditions in a room far far away.  Temperature and humidy are metrics - best stored as a time series, probably in Prometheus.  I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://prometheus.io/&#34;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, both at work and for home projects.  I have a nice &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/gonetmon&#34;&gt;home network traffic analysis system built around it&lt;/a&gt;.  Still pondering about the motion sensor parts - but likely would just use those as direct entries into AlertManager.  This is all thinking based around work we did on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/sphereit/&#34;&gt;Observability Framework&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier testing had me quite fond of these &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/WHDTS-RCWL-0516-Microwave-Induction-Detection/dp/B0732VQ4Q2/ref=sr_1_5&#34;&gt;radar boards for motion detection&lt;/a&gt;.  The cheap IR sensors work, kinda, but they are big and bulky and I found them to be pain to adjust to the sensitivity I wanted.  I figured these radar boards could be a daughter board of sorts.  If this thing plugs onto the power plug then it could be almost as wide, and that gives me an inch of depth so I could do three boards stacked if I wanted and still have room for a 3D printed case around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project is in the very early stages of thinking and then, along came robotics again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;robotics&#34;&gt;Robotics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last ten years or so I&amp;rsquo;ve coached a lot of educational robotics (FLL and VEX).  I keep meaning to write more about what I find WRONG with them, but I never seem to do it.  The core idea of my disatisfaction is that the existing programs de-emphasize coding, and de-emphasize creativity, all in favor of adopting a specific program, product, and framework.  Which is fine, unless you want to break out of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just learned of &lt;a href=&#34;https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/&#34;&gt;a new competition called Pi Wars at Home&lt;/a&gt;.  I am really encouraging folks to check it out.  This has rekindled my thinking around robotics, especially how to make it more approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rbot&#34;&gt;RBOT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had huge grand plans in early 2019 to build an &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/rbot-value-prop/&#34;&gt;actuator board I called RBOT&lt;/a&gt;.  The problem is that it was vastly more work than one person could do.  Even if I completely ignored my wife and kids - not something I want to do - there just was not enough time to build and debug the board AND then build and debug the sensors.  And, in hindsight, the choice of the ESP32 really would have caused a HUGE time investment that probably would have ended up being counter to some of my core principles.  I really want this platform to be open to MORE people learning to code (especially teenagers) not less.  The learning curve of ESP32 and FreeRTOS is almost certainly too steep for most of them.  It would not have been an approachable tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plans for RBOT were to use a ESP32-PICO-KIT-V4 as the compute daughterboard.  It costs $8 at Digikey or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-ESP-WROOM-32-Development-Microcontroller-Integrated/dp/B0718T232Z/ref=sr_1_1_sspa&#34;&gt;$11 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.  I actually designed a specific way to support that as a daughterboard.  I developed an &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32-pico-v4-library/&#34;&gt;Eagle part for it&lt;/a&gt;.  Now &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&amp;term=1-YEAR&amp;support=ADVANCED&amp;quantity=1&#34;&gt;Eagle&lt;/a&gt; is stupidly bundled with Fushion 360 - that I don&amp;rsquo;t need - so it&amp;rsquo;s not even worth playing with the limited free version.  It&amp;rsquo;s time to spend some time learning &lt;a href=&#34;https://kicad-pcb.org/&#34;&gt;KiCad&lt;/a&gt;.  Damn.  More wasted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, my plan had been to use the ESP32 board.  But wait&amp;hellip; the Raspberry Pi Zero Wireless is $10. Cheaper. And it&amp;rsquo;s a real linux machine.  Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s single core and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot slower than a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, but it&amp;rsquo;s likely much faster than the ESP32.  And developing the code will be MUCH easier.  And much more approachable for teenagers and makers in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;raspberry-pi-zero-w&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi Zero W&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bought one. Here it is with a sensor breakout board connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/rpizw.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s just a BME280 temperature and humidity sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gherlein@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo i2cdetect -y 1
[sudo] password for gherlein:

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sensor is detected, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes, for posterity.  You really want to treat these boards as headless.  That means you reall want to network enable them right away.  [Here](&lt;a href=&#34;https://desertbot.io/blog/setup-pi-zero-w-headless-wifi&#34;&gt;https://desertbot.io/blog/setup-pi-zero-w-headless-wifi&lt;/a&gt;_ is a post with details on that, but the key things are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# mount the SD card and cd into the /boot folder
touch /Volumes/boot/ssh
touch /Volumes/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then edit wpa_supplicant.conf to include your details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;country=US
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1

network={
    ssid=&amp;#34;NETWORK-NAME&amp;#34;
    psk=&amp;#34;NETWORK-PASSWORD&amp;#34;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pi will use zeroconf so that you can directly ssh it without setting up any DNS foo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then set it up like usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software&#34;&gt;Software&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just starting on planning the software.  Stay tuned.  Still pondering if I should leverage the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/i2c/dev-interface&#34;&gt;linux sysfs interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/i2c/writing-clients.html&#34;&gt;write my own i2c drivers&lt;/a&gt;, or just stay in user space and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/&#34;&gt;go direct to the devices&lt;/a&gt;.  Design time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goodbye Ubuntu, Hello Debian my old friend</title>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Ubuntu just went too far with the snap crap.  Back to Debian!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first installed Linux in 1994 (I think).  The kernel was pre-1.0 and the distribution was slackware - if it was even called that then.  A huge stack of floppies.  I would compile my own kernel and fail all the time and have to revert back to a known good kernel.  That was in the LILO days, way before grub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as one gets older and has less free time I just wanted things to work.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to build everything from source.  I just wanted to install software and use it.  I had used Debian for years because it was stable, but over time I also wanted to play a lot.  I was doing a lot of embedded development for my robotics hpobbies and generally playing with a lot of stuff.  And getting proprietary drivers onto my machines was something I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of time for and Debian is famous for open source purity.  Ubuntu was easily the most popular so I went with it.  I totally hated Unity and actually went to Mint for a long time but in January of 2019 I went back to Ubuntu.  I &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-18.04/&#34;&gt;blogged about it&lt;/a&gt; even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a lot of playing with some small computers, including a new Raspberry Pi4 (which I returned in disgust, but that&amp;rsquo;s a different post).  I was burning bootable ISOs to USB thumb drives quite a bit.  Along the way I found that for whatever reason, if I burned it from my Ubuntu notebook the drive would not boot.  I never did really solve that, for reasons that will become apparent in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really drove me nuts what the whole snap thing, adding a ton of mounted filesystems to my machine.  WTF was all that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/snap_mounts.png&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;320&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to take a screen shot of the insanity but found this shot in my research.  It turns out that lots of folks are pissed about this, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackaday.com/2020/06/24/whats-the-deal-with-snap-packages/&#34;&gt;Hackaday article&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good.  Go read that.  It will do a better job than I will explaining this mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what was the problem?  I plugged in a USB thumb drive and typed &amp;rsquo;lsblk&amp;quot; and suddenly had this HUGE long list of snap packages mounted on loopback.  I had NEVER used snap - only apt.  Seeing what drives were mounted was cluttered by all this unwanted, never asked for loopback snap crap.  I was amazed and angry.  A fast google search and I found I was not alone.  Go back.  Read that article.  it will explain it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tl;dr:  Ubuntu was using snap to install software behind my back.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use snap, but they were doing it without asking.  And it&amp;rsquo;s totally proprietary to Cannonical. And it&amp;rsquo;s a totally stupid approach that solves THEIR business problem at the expense of their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my core point:  Cannonical is playing the same kind of games that Microsoft did back in the day.  Embrace and Extend.  Snap is a terrible idea.  It&amp;rsquo;s a hack at best.  They could have gone open source - even gone towards using actual container technology but they did not.  They invented something proprietary and started ramming it down our throats.  It&amp;rsquo;s abouot control.  If you control the distribution of software, you have a control point over the linux world.  That was the kind of bad behavior that us Linux folks fought long ago.  Why on earth would we support it in a Linux vendor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s still a free country.  Cannonical can do what they want with Ubuntu.  But I can make choices too - and my open source roots run really deep.  So Ubuntu is out.  Off my systems.  I grabbed Debian Buster and to my surprise it installed easily on my Dell.  I had to install non-free wifi:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# add contrib non-free per https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList
apt install -y firmware-realtek firmware-iwlwifi
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did have to re-install when I also put the Nvidia drivers on and I lost all my video.  I still don&amp;rsquo;t have working HDMI output but I&amp;rsquo;ll fiddle with that next week.  I am writing this from Tahoe (snuck away for a few days of warmth in the mountains) and I have not even booted my work MacBook Pro.  I&amp;rsquo;m using my Debian notebook and am completely happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll post more later about how I fix the HDMI issue.  But for now, I&amp;rsquo;m just happy to have a real linux system again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Blast from the past - Linux Telephony API</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/lti/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jun 2020 03:10:43 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/lti/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;A trip down memory lane:  the first linux telephony drivers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in the first bubble - y&amp;rsquo;all remember that one? - I was consulting through my own company (Herlein Engineering).  This was 1997 or so, and I was doing just fine doing linux development.  Linux was BOOMING and I had lots of work.  It seemed to me that the next thing on the internet was going to be voice over IP.  I know, 23 years later is seems like a no-brainer but at the time most people didn&amp;rsquo;t believe it would work.  Too much latency, they said.  Not enough bandwidth, they said.  Ha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-quicknet&#34;&gt;Enter Quicknet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found these cards made by a company called Quicknet.  They had a PhoneJack and a LineJack - one to plug a phone into and another that could plug into the phone system - the PSTN.  I suppose that still exists - but in those days you definitely had it because that was the ONLY way to connect to the internet.  Using a 56kbaud modem.  Remember that?  Anyway, these cards were ISA and PCI (remember those?) and interfaced a computer to the phone system.  But they were Windows only.  Hmmm.  I did not run Windows on ANYTHING from 1994&amp;hellip; well, ever since then.  What&amp;rsquo;s a linux guy to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hack it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fiddled around and probed and prodded.  I&amp;rsquo;d done some driver work before.  I&amp;rsquo;d fixed some bugs in RS-485 drivers (remember RS-485?) and also done some fun modifications to ethernet drivers to adapt them to work on some new wireless cards.  I figured I&amp;rsquo;d play and see if I could get something working.  I got fairly far, but was getting stuck.  So I just called Quicknet.  Turns out they were also in San Francisco (as was I) and oddly enough, they put me right through to the VP Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told me that no, they were not going to do linux drivers but that I should talk to this guy in Texas.  Quicknet would share what information they could that was not under NDA to their chip vendors.  So I called Ed Okerson and not only was a friendship started, but a partnership that ended up lasting through several companies.  He and I hacked on a driver and one day we made a call to each other over the internet - &amp;ldquo;first voice&amp;rdquo; we called it.  We took it to Quicknet to show them and I called Ed from the Quicknet office - which was in a basement of a building on Townsend right across from the CalTrain station.  They made us job offers before I left the building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year was wild.  We did a lot of work to get an early &amp;ldquo;skype&amp;rdquo; system working - all on linux, and all years and years before skype ever happened.  We open sourced our drivers and made some really cool stuff.  A lot of those folks are still in touch, even though the company never went anywhere.  Supposedly Cisco made an offer to buy the company at one point, but when the bubble burst so did Quicknet.  Lots of dreams died with Quicknet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s crumbs of what we did way back then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://lwn.net/1999/1223/a/quicknet.html&#34;&gt;Driver announcement email to Linux Weekly News 1999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3511&#34;&gt;VoIP on Linux - Linux Journal 1999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4468&#34;&gt;The Linux Telephony Kernel API - Linux Journal 2001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.huihoo.com/doxygen/linux/kernel/3.7/ixjuser_8h_source.html&#34;&gt;IXJ header file from 3.7.1 kernel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what&#34;&gt;So What&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, so what.  We didn&amp;rsquo;t move the needle.  The API was never adopted by other projects.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.asterisk.org/&#34;&gt;Asterisk&lt;/a&gt; went on to be the default linux phone system (and good for them!  Mark Spencer had the tenacity and courage to stay focused and he sure did well.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/A+Brief+History+of+the+Asterisk+Project&#34;&gt;Linux Support Services later became Digium&lt;/a&gt; and while there was a short period of trying to work together it never played out.  Mark was smart to be in Alabama where his costs were low.  Quicknet was in San Francisco where costs were high.  Quicknet&amp;rsquo;s vision never came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lessons-learned&#34;&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is amazing.  We &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; right about that.  We knew that linux would be the foundation for many innovations.  Now look at it:  Android phones.  Just about every TV set top box runs linux.  Just about every virtual machine in the cloud is linux.  Even Microsoft - the great evil - is now embracing linux and you can run a real kernel inside Windows 10.  Who would have thought?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons we learned from building all that put all of us on a coourse for better things.  And yes, laid the foundation for a life-long love of linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing again.  Have some ideas.  Embedded Linux.  Picking up where my &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.herlein.com/post/rbot-value-prop/&#34;&gt;RBOT&lt;/a&gt; ideas left off.  Once a hacker, always a hacker.  Stay tuned&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Docs as Code</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/docs-as-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2020 03:10:43 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/docs-as-code/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;One of the core principles of modern &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; development is to treat your documentation as code, just like code.  My team at Cisco open sourced how we do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-docs-as-code&#34;&gt;Why Docs as Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate documentation for any software project is the code itself.  But for sets of code - especially today&amp;rsquo;s interconnected micro-services - having some kind of documentation is essential to being able to onboard new developers. More importantly, documentation is important for Operations.  Not only is the system design needed, the details of how to deploy and operate complex software needs to be written down.  Larger teams sometimes even have professional technical writers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best people to write the docs are the people who wrote the code. If you want writers to clean it up that&amp;rsquo;s fine. But the Engineers who built it know it best. So if for no other reason you should use tooling that the Engineers already use. But more on tooling later. The Engineers need to write code, and to make sure it&amp;rsquo;s accurate you should follow the same process as for code:  do a code review on the documentation. And how do we do that?  In git, of course. Github, to be specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend (and mandate it in our teams) that the docs are reviewed by at least one additional qualified Engineer before it&amp;rsquo;s merged to master. This workflow is exactly what we do for code so it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to train on and roll out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-not-word-or-whatever&#34;&gt;Why Not Word (or whatever)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any word processor is going to be orthogonal to the workflow the Engineers are going to want to use.  They are in a text editor all day, every day. If they are not you have different problems. They are in an editor and in github.  Why break out of that to use a tool they don&amp;rsquo;t normally use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, word processors like Microsoft Word save in formats that are not friendly to git. If you want to read a pull request (PR) you don&amp;rsquo;t want a bunch of binary stuff in there: you want to see the change, and nothing but the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Text&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We settled on using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&#34;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt; as our core text format. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to learn, easy to read, fully text based, git friendly, and most projects are already writing a README in it anyway. Why mess with a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diagrams&#34;&gt;Diagrams&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve had good luck with using either &lt;a href=&#34;https://plantuml.com/&#34;&gt;PlatUML&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html&#34;&gt;Graphviz&lt;/a&gt;. So far, for the kinds of diagrams we need to build those have done the trick. Whether we are building block diagrams, sequence diagrams, or entity-relationship diagrams, these tools do the trick. And they are still pure text, and git friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-tooling---compiling-to-output&#34;&gt;Our Tooling - Compiling to Output&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we are on a theme of doing docs as code, how do we &amp;ldquo;compile&amp;rdquo; the docs into desired output formats? Typical formats for consumption include HTML, PDF, and EPUB electronic book. This is where &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandoc.org/&#34;&gt;pandoc&lt;/a&gt; comes to the rescue. But installing the right tools and remembering how to use them was always difficult - especially to have the templates put together for formating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put all this together driven by makefile and the tools all dockerized. We creatively call this &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cisco-cx/docs-as-code&#34;&gt;Docs as Code&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and Cisco approved releasing it open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usage&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cisco-cx/docs-as-code&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; is a &amp;ldquo;template&amp;rdquo; repository. All you have to do is click the green &amp;ldquo;Use this template&amp;rdquo; button and instead of forking you can make a totally new repository using it as a template. You can then just work in that new repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an example-template folder with a good working example.  The overall template is in common/pandoc/templates but the default is pretty usable. You will want to make your own logo and drop it into common/images instead of the very ugly generic logo that we put there as a placeholder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;change-the-title-in-the-makefile&#34;&gt;Change the title in the Makefile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the title of the output document, change the OUT_NAME in the Makefile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OUT_NAME := example-template
DIR_NAME := $(PWD)

include ../common/Makefile
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-the-document-attributes&#34;&gt;Setting the Document Attributes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the title, subtitle, and to control the various document attributes you can edit the &amp;ldquo;pp&amp;rdquo; directives in the main.md file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
title: The Title
subtitle: 0.1.0 - Confidentiality Statement Goes Here
author: [&amp;#34;First Author1&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Second Author2&amp;#34;]

echo &amp;#34;date: Build Date $(date --iso-8601=date)&amp;#34;

---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following folks did the heavy lifting on this effort:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Terraform in AWS:  use AMI Names not IDs - and is Terraform the right answer still?</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/terraform/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:21:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/terraform/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;In AWS the AMI ID for a particular VM image is unique to that region.  But it&amp;rsquo;s name is consistent across AWS.  When building infra-as-code (such as terraform) use the name, not the ID.  And some musings on terraform.  Is it still the right answer for infra-as-code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile since I did anything real with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34;&gt;terraform&lt;/a&gt;.  My teams use it heavily at work but a lot of my personal projects lately have not been cloud based.  So yesterday I took a day off (for my own mental health) and did some things that make me happy.  Including some coding.  Which included refreshing a bit on terraform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that annoys me about Cannonical is their insistence on using only silly code names (e.g. trusty, precise, focal, etc.) and not including the release numbers (e.g. 16.04, 18.10, 20.04, etc.).  I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the release names, but the numbers are date based and easy to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ami-ids&#34;&gt;AMI IDs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To launch an EC2 instance you need to tell AWS what OS to launch.  This is the AMI ID.  Lots of helpful web pages will point you at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/&#34;&gt;Cannonical lookup page&lt;/a&gt; where you can easily find these.
But AMI IDs are not consistent across regions.  A basic latest 20.04 amd64 Ubuntu image in us-west-2 is ami-004e1dc83789471c1 but in us-east-2 it&amp;rsquo;s ami-0769e4bb31e1db8e4.  If you aspire to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself&#34;&gt;DRY principles&lt;/a&gt; then having to change a variable to a script just because I want to run the same thing in a different region is really lame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ami-names&#34;&gt;AMI Names&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, I learned something yesterday:  the NAME of the image is consistent.  Now, if you look at the Cannonical lookup page it tells you the &amp;ldquo;name&amp;rdquo; is basically their release code name (e.g. trusty, precise, focal, etc).  Not really helpful. Back to Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s reliance on silly names not numbered releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you find the names?  AWS CLI to the rescue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;aws ec2 describe-images   --region us-west-2 --filters &amp;#34;Name=name, Values=*ubuntu-*-20.04-amd64-server-*&amp;#34; |grep \&amp;#34;Name
            &amp;#34;Name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20200528&amp;#34;,
            &amp;#34;Name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20200423-aced0818-eef1-427a-9e04-8ba38bada306-ami-068663a3c619dd892.4&amp;#34;,
            &amp;#34;Name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20200423&amp;#34;,
            &amp;#34;Name&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;ubuntu-pro/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-20200423-ae7ed378-8838-4fcf-842d-d1d09b34f116-ami-0118f3de163338756.4&amp;#34;,            
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is the filter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt; --filters &amp;#34;Name=name, Values=*ubuntu-*-20.04-amd64-server-*&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I was looking for another Ubuntu release - or perhaps for arm64 not amd64 - I could change that and find the name.  From what I can tell there&amp;rsquo;s a naming convention they follow, but I&amp;rsquo;m a &amp;ldquo;trust but verify&amp;rdquo; kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK.  Now I know I have a name that I can look up.  The CLI gave me four options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-need-to-know-the-full-names&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Need to Know the Full Names!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t actually need to know the full names.  We can do the same kind of search right in terraform, and luckily terraform provides a way to select the most recent AMI, conveniently with this snip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;  most_recent = true
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample terraform that will launch an EC2 instance using the latest Ubuntu 20.04 image:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;provider &amp;#34;aws&amp;#34; {
 region = &amp;#34;us-west-2&amp;#34;
}

data &amp;#34;aws_ami&amp;#34; &amp;#34;ubuntu&amp;#34; {
  most_recent = true

  filter {
    name   = &amp;#34;name&amp;#34;
    values = [&amp;#34;*ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*&amp;#34;]
  }

  filter {
        name   = &amp;#34;virtualization-type&amp;#34;
        values = [&amp;#34;hvm&amp;#34;]
  }
  owners = [&amp;#34;099720109477&amp;#34;] # Canonical

}

resource &amp;#34;aws_instance&amp;#34; &amp;#34;simple&amp;#34; {
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = &amp;#34;t2.micro&amp;#34;

  tags = {
    Name = &amp;#34;HelloWorld&amp;#34;
  }
}

output &amp;#34;image_id&amp;#34; {
    value = &amp;#34;${data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id}&amp;#34;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;is-terraform-still-the-right-choice-for-infra-as-code&#34;&gt;Is Terraform Still the Right Choice for Infra-As-Code?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is just a toy.  In a production setting I would want to create a VPC, set security groups, etc.  I spent some time yesterday with this.  Terraform is technically the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html&#34;&gt;Hashicorp Configuration Language&lt;/a&gt; which isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to learn for basics but non-trivial for large deployments.  I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to revisit the state of all this stuff for infra-as-code.  I&amp;rsquo;m torn.  I&amp;rsquo;m all in for infra-as-code, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong.  But terraform is a programming language all of it&amp;rsquo;s own now, and the more you invest in that the farther you get from regular team software Engineers doing the infra deployments.  This tends to push the &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; team towards a separate group (which is happening in my day job) which is the wrong direction in my opinion.  If your regualr team that codes in golang (one hopes) or java (run away) or node or ruby or whatever&amp;hellip; if that team has to learn a complex new language to deploy their cloud then it adds a LOT to the cognitive load.  They are already writing helm charts, probably, so yet another language might be tipping the boat over.  This is a good reason to wonder again if &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/vs/terraform/&#34;&gt;Pulumi&lt;/a&gt; might be worth another look.  Or go back to pure python with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/quickstart.html&#34;&gt;boto3&lt;/a&gt; libraries, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/&#34;&gt;golang with the AWS API&lt;/a&gt;.  Not cloud-agnostic, but with the deep hooks the cloud vendors have into all of us is there any such thing as multi-cloud?  Really?  Even terraform is so cloud-specific it&amp;rsquo;s another code base - one per cloud.  This is something for further study.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Black Lives Matter</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/blm/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;We all protest and effect change in our own ways.  I choose mentorship, education, and work - because that&amp;rsquo;s what I can do best to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past week has been a series of terrible and tragic events, all stemming directly from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd&#34;&gt;the killing of George Floyd&lt;/a&gt; - a black man - by a group of white police officers.  The same thing again.  Only this time, the entire nine minute assault was caught on camera and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty evident that this was a crime.  You cannot watch that and not feel sick.  And then, as people rightously took to the streets to protest this repeat of racist murder, the police - many of them at least - took the violence to another level by ruthlessly shooting, hitting, shoving and assaulting people who were not threatening them.  It&amp;rsquo;s not worth repeating the Police-induced horrors.  Other press venues can summarize it better than I.  And then Trump and his goons got into it and things went even further downhill.  What started as police brutality tipped towards a police state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The looting prevalent the first few nights faded and from my upper middle class perspective seem to have faded - but the protests continue.  And they should. Change does not happen by asking &amp;ldquo;pretty please.&amp;rdquo;  The systemic racism in America is on display.  Sure, it seemed that we&amp;rsquo;d come farther than this.  After all, we elected a Black President.  And parts of society did change.  Major companies, including my employer Cisco, are taking this far more seriously.  But it would be easy to be pessimistic that once the anger of the masses seeps away after the next bad news cycle (probably about a spike in COVID deaths, or some further bad news about the economy) that we will slip back to a place where little changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;four-major-issues&#34;&gt;Four Major Issues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s at least four major issues I see coming out of this chaos, and all of them are important.  Police brutality towards Black people.  Policing in general, including the shift to militarization of our beat cops.  Racial in-equality overall in America.  The shredding of Constitutional rights by the Trump Administration.  The last one could easily dominate.  The rage at Police beating up white people isn&amp;rsquo;t going to go away soon - that&amp;rsquo;s part of the racist problem too, actually.  What could fade from sufficient public discourse is that very racist problem.  And equaly important, what are we going to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go out into the streets and march.  I never have though.  Not because I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with the sentiment, but because it&amp;rsquo;s just not me.  I&amp;rsquo;m an introvert at heart.  In the grand scheme protesting raises awareness.  That&amp;rsquo;s important.  Critical.  But it&amp;rsquo;s also important to follow it up with action that makes a difference.  That&amp;rsquo;s where I always have put my energy.  That&amp;rsquo;s where I choose to put my energy now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-im-going-to-do&#34;&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m Going to Do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mentor&#34;&gt;Mentor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco has invested in change even before this, and I&amp;rsquo;m doubling my commitment to those programs.  We have a &amp;ldquo;Talent Expo&amp;rdquo; as a structured program of mentorship and connections.  The &amp;ldquo;Talent Expo provides a place for senior leaders and members of the African American/ Black Community to get proximate to one another, share their career stories, and create connections.&amp;rdquo;  I can tell you my mentors made all the difference for me.  I was homeless as a teenager, spent most of my childhood on welfare, and started with nothing.  I had no clue.  Sometimes I still don&amp;rsquo;t.  Having successful senior people to advise me is a huge part of my success.  Systemic discrimination deprives women and People of Color of that tool through limiting their connections.  This program - and another that is aimed at mentoring someone who &amp;ldquo;does not look like you&amp;rdquo; - aim to fix that at the ground level.  My action plan is to not only double down on my participation, but to spread it.  I want more people involved in this.  I want it to reach farther than just Cisco.  It has to reach into the youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer to changing the hate in the hearts of some people.  Hate that historically suppressed opportunity.  Suppressed equality.  Suppressed the very American dream that allowed me to have a chance.  From where I came from, if I was not white I would not be where I am today.  If I was Black, I would not have had the job opportunities I had.  That&amp;rsquo;s where I can make a difference.  That&amp;rsquo;s how I can help.  I can make opportunities for others.  I can help mentor, and teach, and listen, and then make more opportunities for others.  I can and I will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So no, you won&amp;rsquo;t see me out there with a sign yelling.  I support everyone who is doing that.  Completely.  Keep it up.  I&amp;rsquo;m with you in spirit.  But I&amp;rsquo;m going to put my energy into making change for tomorrow.  It&amp;rsquo;s not as visible, but it&amp;rsquo;s the best way I can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;listen&#34;&gt;Listen!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to listen.  I want to hear more personal stories.  I plan to read, to hear, to learn.  I&amp;rsquo;m a white man.  I grew up most of my childhood as one of the only white families in a very Chicano area, so I&amp;rsquo;m not a stranger to predjudice.  But I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be Black in America.  And I need to learn more.  So I will make the time to listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;delete-facebook&#34;&gt;Delete Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook is the most divisive and destructive force in America today, and all so that Zuckerberg and some rich folks can get richer.  They knowningly fan the flames and profit off the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I deleted my account.  I urge you do so as well.  Go listen to someone in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;vote&#34;&gt;Vote!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and vote.  VOTE.  And help candidates that promote genuine inclusivity and equality.  Who support the rule of law.  Who listen more than they speak.  Who actually know what the Constitution says.  We must have elected officials that will actually hold Police accountable for their actions.  We must change the way we fund and train Police.  There is no reason to transfer excess Military equipment to Police forces, or train them in how to use Military equipment.  We need to train them in de-escalation.  We need to weed out the bad apples who became Police because of the power, and make it safer for the good cops to speak up - anonymously if that&amp;rsquo;s what it takes.  We need to get serious about Education and stop looking at it like it&amp;rsquo;s a Liberal vs Conservative thing and realize it&amp;rsquo;s a US survival thing.  We need leaders who will tackle the problem, not pander to one side or the other to assure their own reelection.  VOTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Lives Matter.  Sure all lives matter.  But that misses the point of this moment, and this injustice, and this specific set of things we need to do - must do.  Black Lives Matter.  “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”  Don&amp;rsquo;t let Evil win.  Do SOMETHING.  I know what I am going to do.  Do you?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Link to posted video &amp;ldquo;CloudSphere: Impedance Matching Legacy Apps to Prometheus Monitoring by Greg Herlein &amp;amp; David Wang&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall David and I spoke at SphereIT in Krakow Poland.  Great conference, great Engineers in Poland!  Just getting aroound to posting this.  I have some other catchups to do too, but been busy lately (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s yet another story too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHHvX5HloYQ&#34;&gt;CloudSphere: Impedance Matching Legacy Apps to Prometheus Monitoring by Greg Herlein &amp;amp; David Wang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/h2&gt;

      <title>Make RDP work from OSX</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/rdp/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Quick reminder how to enable RDP sessions from OSX to an Ubuntu box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stupid little thing, but when you want to use your MacBook and remote desktop to an Ubuntu notebook - I know, that&amp;rsquo;s kinda rare - but alas.  Using the built in OSX screen sharing app will work, but Ubuntu needs a tweak from the command line to disable encryption:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gsettings set org.gnome.Vino require-encryption false
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credits to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/463486/can-no-longer-use-screen-share-to-connect-mac-to-ubuntu-since-upgrading-to-14-04&#34;&gt;reddit post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things are too hard for normal people, and I suspect it&amp;rsquo;s all around making it &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; to just stay all within one ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SSH Tunnels</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ssh-tunnels/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 06:40:43 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ssh-tunnels/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;SSH tunnels are basically indistinguishable from magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a remote network that I want to access.  Most of my gear is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ui.com/&#34;&gt;Unifi Networking&lt;/a&gt; equipment (that&amp;rsquo;s another post about why) so one simple thing would be to do a site-to-site VPN.  Alas, the remote network does not expose a publicly routable IP address.  It&amp;rsquo;s deep into my ISP&amp;rsquo;s private network space (10.etc.).  Setting site to site VPN is thus pretty much off the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the time I just need to ssh to a server on that remote network.  So a vanilla SSH tunnel is perfect.  It&amp;rsquo;s pointless for me to document here how to do that - there&amp;rsquo;s really great pages on it all over the net.  So many, in fact, you will get confused.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.everythingcli.org/ssh-tunnelling-for-fun-and-profit-autossh/&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a page&lt;/a&gt; that I found not only accurate, but has all the details you will need to make the tunnel &amp;ldquo;operational.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By operational I mean that it &amp;ldquo;just works.&amp;rdquo;  Even if you lose power and everything reboots.  That article goes over how to configure systemd to make that happen.  It&amp;rsquo;s not that hard, and there are not that many steps.  You will need a VM in the cloud somewhere or a linux box on a public IP.  I have a linode host for these kinds of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, all that is vanilla.  The problem I was having was that I needed to access a web page on an appliance on the remote network.  The vendor didn&amp;rsquo;t make a means to upgrade the firmware from a CLI - I needed web access.  I fiddled and farted and I tried this and I tried that and nothing was working all that well.  So I called my good friend David Wang and talked him through it all.  I was re-assured that he thought it was complicated too.  It was him that had the epiphany that this was not a two hop problem.  I did not need to make a second proxy that jumped to the linode VM that jumped to the remote network. It was a one hop from localhost:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh  -N -D &amp;lt;local port, like 8080&amp;gt; &amp;lt;public host&amp;gt; -p &amp;lt;ssh tunnel port&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell Firefox to use a &amp;ldquo;Manual Proxy Configuration&amp;rdquo; set to localhost on local port (like 8080) and make sure you select SOCKS v5.  Point your browser at the remote host on the remote network and&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked.  Just worked.  Like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur C Clark said any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.  SSH tunnels fit that bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe they will help you someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things I want to play with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can I make the Unifi USG run the ssh tunnel natively?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can I run the ssh host VM on my network and have the remote host hit my firewall and port forward to the internal host?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Baking Sourdough Bread</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/bread/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Mar 2020 08:21:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/bread/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;My first attempt baking sourdough bread led to tasty, but flat loaves.  Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 thing has given me more time.  No weekend driving to multiple soccer games alone frees up a lot of hours.  I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a bread lover and long ago had a bread machine.  But now I wanted to really get into baking true San Francisco sourdough - from scratch.  The gold standard, in my opinion, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://tartinebakery.com/&#34;&gt;Tartine Bakery&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; so I know what standard I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for, but am unlikely to reach that level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My starting point was an &lt;a href=&#34;https://cooking.nytimes.com/guides/59-how-to-make-sourdough-bread&#34;&gt;article in the New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.  I cheated and got some starter from my good friend Jaime.  We met up with her at Moscone Park, keeping appropriate social distancing and wiping off the jar before we brought it in the house.  I always love that yeast is alive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/starter.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, you really should read Jaimie&amp;rsquo;s blog &lt;a href=&#34;http://lessonthefloor.com/&#34;&gt;Less on the Floor&lt;/a&gt;.  She&amp;rsquo;s a wonderful, witty writer.  Her posts about raising kids in San Francisco will make you happy.  I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to bread.  I had no idea what I was doing really.  I had baked with my Grandmother as a kid but I remember eating it more than making it.  And that was a scary long time ago.  So, I literally just followed the instructions and ended up with some loafs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/shaping-bread.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the bread tangy so I let it proof in the fridge for two days.  That&amp;rsquo;s what the instructions said to do.  But&amp;hellip; it was definitely fallen - the light and fluffy alive bread dough that I started end up much flatter than I wanted.  When it came out of the oven it looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/out-of-oven.jpeg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely flat.  Excellent crust.  Wonderful flavor.  But definitely flat.  What&amp;rsquo;s a geek like me to do but read on the web about what I did wrong?  I found an &lt;a href=&#34;https://thebreadguide.com/why-does-my-bread-collapse-or-flatten/&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; that explained it clearly.  Simply put: my dough had underdeveloped gluten mesh, which let the gas bubbles escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-did-wrong&#34;&gt;What I Did Wrong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NYT article was a great start, but it missed teaching a few things.  First:  the flour matters.  You need proteins in the flour to make the gluten mesh.  I mixed in rye flour, as specified, but that flour has a much lower protein content.  I needed to use bread flour, not general purpose flour, to offset that lower protein.  Also, I definitely did not knead it long enough.  Don&amp;rsquo;t give up after 20 minutes, as it says.  Then, letting it sit in the fridge for two days just lets all the gas out, like a helium balloon left overnight.  I should have paid attention and let the dough tell me when it was time to bake it.  It&amp;rsquo;s alive, after all.  I was not listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a strong gluten mesh the dough got over-proofed, as they say.  And the result was a tasty, but very flat, loaf of bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;trying-again&#34;&gt;Trying Again&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, today I&amp;rsquo;m trying again.  We had some bread flour so I used that along with some rye flour, so the protein content should start higher.  I&amp;rsquo;ll knead like crazy.  And I&amp;rsquo;ll pay attention as it proofs, and let the bread tell me when it&amp;rsquo;s time to bake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;ll let you know how it turns out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;updated&#34;&gt;UPDATED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/covid-19/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;The impacts of COVID-19 are really not upon us yet.  But some of them are hitting, and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d jot some notes about how it&amp;rsquo;s hitting us here in SF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll make the time to blog to try to provide updates.  I won&amp;rsquo;t post them all to social media since frankly I&amp;rsquo;d rather not have my musings monetized by tech companies wiht questionable ethics.  Yes, Facebook, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ella&amp;rsquo;s high school is closed for nominally 2 weeks.  Right.  It will be more.  All SF schools closed.  Luca is waiting to board a flight as I write this, coming home from CU Boulder where classes will be virtual for the remainder of the semester.  Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to get him home safe.  I usually work from home, but all Cisco employees are WFH now.  My normal is the new normal.  Erin is fine, worried as hell and wanting her kids here and not let them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all about social distancing right now.  Seriously folks.  Don&amp;rsquo;t mess around.  Erin has family in Northern Italy and they are saying it&amp;rsquo;s no joke, it&amp;rsquo;s not a hoax.  300+ dead TODAY in Italy.  This thing is going to sweep like wildfire and we need to flatten the curve.  To all my younger friends who are out partying:  go home.  You can carry it.  You&amp;rsquo;ll infect someone who is more at risk.  You can KILL PEOPLE.  Just go home.  Watch some movies, read a book.  Make some babies.  Drink a nice martini, or a bottle of wine.  Now&amp;rsquo;s the time to explore that wine cellar you bought anyway!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your hands aren&amp;rsquo;t dry and a bit sore you are either not washing them enough, or you are using a good hand cream to keep your skin happy.  Wash.  Obcess about it.  Clean everything, then do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin laughed at me because I bought 60 pounds of rice.  Have you ever thought about how fragile our just in time supply chain is?  If the folks who drive the trucks that stock your grocery all get sick then the shelves will go bare.  And then what?  What will you eat when there&amp;rsquo;s no food to buy in the store?  I may be overthinking this, but rice lasts forever and I spent enough hungry nights as a kid when we had jack-shit to eat.  My family will eat.  I&amp;rsquo;m a big boy.  I can handle you all laughing at me.  I pray I&amp;rsquo;m not the one with the last laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With luck, we flatten out this curve and we can ride this out.  Luck and some enlightened leadership.  Which is not going to happen at the Federal level, but it seems a lot of states are getting their act together.  A lot of people will die from this.  A lot of small businesses are going to go under.  A lot of service industry folks are going to really get hit.  A lot of people are going to go into really bad debt trying to save their family members who get this really bad.  We are going to have to come together as a country, as a world, and put things back together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, my family is hibernating.  Once I get Luca tonight we&amp;rsquo;re hunkering down.  You know where to find us.  We&amp;rsquo;re online - not the mega-corp controlled online that some folks think is the &amp;ldquo;internet&amp;rdquo; but the real Internet.  And I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you that the difference between 1918 and today is that today we have access to the real facts.  I hope all the folks that only get their news and facts from certain narrow sources (Fox News cough cough) learn to read wider, study more.  Sure, some of the sources are biased (so is Fox) but if all the scientists around the world are saying one thing and any news outlet is saying somethign else&amp;hellip; then folks, you need to trust the scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flatten the curve.  That&amp;rsquo;s it.  Flatten the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Not Everyone Needs to Go To College</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/college/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s wrong, and possibly dangerous, to just make college free for anyone who wants it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. If I was a politician, I&amp;rsquo;d get attacked for that.  But that&amp;rsquo;s totally how I see it. As we move into
political sniping season more and more focus will get put on candidate spending plans.  Several have said
they want to make college free.  Boy, that sounds good.  Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like free?   One plan talks about abolishing
student loan debt.  Which, admitedly, is crushing a whole generation who bought into the same notion I&amp;rsquo;m talking about
now:  that going to college is a necessarily good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not.  Maybe not for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a huge believer in education, and my son is about to head off to college (Colorado Boulder, in Aerospace
Engineering). There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of thing you HAVE to college for: nursing, medicine, engineering, law, teaching, etc.
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of huge value in getting a degree, especially if you are going to go into management or work
in many analytical fields.  But everyone?  If EVERYONE goes to college, who builds houses?  Who installs the
electrical system?  Who build the sheet metal ducts for your air conditioning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trades.  Somehow we as a nation have built this cultural belief that success=college, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of
plumbers and carpenters out there that are damn successful.  And where would we be without them?  Crapping in an
outhouse probably.  In the dark.  Seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think about it.  Not everyone is going to have a net rise in income because they got a degree.  Especially if
that degree is not in an area that maps directly to a job category.  There&amp;rsquo;s only so many jobs for the skill set
of a sociology degree.  Or history.  My wife has a Masters in Art History/Museum Studies, but there&amp;rsquo;s only a tiny
number of jobs in the museum industry and she never once worked in that field.  Perhaps if she had moved, maybe.
She worked in the MoMA bookstore I think.  Retail, in the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My nephew has a degree that he worked insanely hard in night school to get. I am very proud of his effort.  He
also has a real estate license, because it was a ticket he had to punch for the office job he had.  What&amp;rsquo;s he doing
now?  He&amp;rsquo;s a driver for medium haul and frieght delivery for UPS.  Now he trains new drivers and was elected
shop steward.  It&amp;rsquo;s a union job, Teamsters.  He makes more money with better benefits than he ever has.  Sure, his
degree helps.  But he loves it because he gets to be outside a lot, and he&amp;rsquo;s naturally a leader that other guys
trust.  He didn&amp;rsquo;t NEED the degree.  I&amp;rsquo;m betting there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of folks just like him too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ll flip it though.  I absolutly think that going to college and getting a degree - and especially getting
the general education - is a great thing.  It&amp;rsquo;s needed.  But my point is that just going to college is not
necessarily going to get you a better income.  And it might saddle you with a lot of debt before you even start.
And as a nation, it might saddle all of us with a lot more debt without accomplishing what we want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we are going to talk about college for all, let&amp;rsquo;s widen the dicussion to include tech schools and the trades.
The Unions are stupidly MISSING THE BOAT (again).  I&amp;rsquo;m pro-Union, but damn are they short sighted.  We should be
including apprentice programs in the discussion.  Training in the trades.  We need electricians, carpenters, and
electronics repair technicians.  Power plants cannot hire enough plant operators and field technicians.  And
while we are at it, why don&amp;rsquo;t we add some certificate programs around small business creation and operation?&lt;br&gt;
You want to grow the economy?  Help young people learn the core details they need to open and run their own
business.  Practical lessons on getting a business license, accounting, employee laws, customer service, etc.
Small businesses have always been a backbone for America.  But who can afford to start a business if they have $50K
of student loan debt they accrued while getting a degree they may not need anyway?  Listen up politicians:  maybe
before we just wipe everyone&amp;rsquo;s student loan debt maybe we think about it.  Maybe you can wipe it if you start
a small business and keep it running for two years.  Or become an inner-city school teacher for a few years.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure we can be creative about it.  Carrots work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thriving community needs diversity, and that means more than color, national origin or gender.  It also means
age, and background.  San Francisco is quickly becoming mostly young and techie.  Sure, for those jobs a
degree is needed (usually - we can talk about whether you really need one for coding).  But get a carpenter.&lt;br&gt;
Or a plumber.  Or someone to remodel your bathroom.  Good luck.  There&amp;rsquo;s not enough who do those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think I&amp;rsquo;m wrong, and I&amp;rsquo;m OK with that.  We can grab a coffee and dicuss it.  Like civilized people.
But to just think that we can send every kid off to college and it&amp;rsquo;s going to help them compete is really naive,
or perhaps affiliated somehow with the money stream going to the college education ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ubuntu Lid Control</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-lid/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2019 18:40:43 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;The default behavior of Ubuntu 18.04 is not friendly for a notebook that swaps back and forth from desk to mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I forget things, I have to write them down.  And sometimes, that is just noting where I found a
good answer to a problem I was having.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I re-installed Ubuntu and out of the box it suspends the host when the lid is closed.  That&amp;rsquo;s great if you are
mobile but terrible if you use the notebook on a KVM or just as a build machine or such sitting on the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we want to meet both cases is a way to suspend on lid close UNLESS the notebook is plugged into power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;acknowledgements---this-work-is-not-mine&#34;&gt;Acknowledgements - This Work Is Not Mine!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution came from &lt;a href=&#34;https://mensfeld.pl/2018/08/ubuntu-18-04-disable-screen-on-lid-close/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  But since
sometimes sites go away I&amp;rsquo;m going to duplicate the content below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solution-from-maciej-mensfeld&#34;&gt;Solution from MacieJ Mensfeld&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to be root.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#sudo -i # really, you need to be root
echo &amp;#39;HandleLidSwitch=ignore&amp;#39; | tee --append /etc/systemd/logind.conf
echo &amp;#39;HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore&amp;#39; | tee --append /etc/systemd/logind.conf
service systemd-logind restart
echo &amp;#39;event=button/lid.*&amp;#39; | tee --append /etc/acpi/events/lm_lid
echo &amp;#39;action=https://blog.herlein.com/etc/acpi/lid.sh&amp;#39; | tee --append /etc/acpi/events/lm_lid
touch /etc/acpi/lid.sh
chmod +x /etc/acpi/lid.sh
cat &amp;gt; /etc/acpi/lid.sh &amp;lt;&amp;lt; EOF
#!/bin/bash
 
USER=your_username
 
grep -q close /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state
 
if [ $? = 0 ]; then
  su -c  &amp;#34;sleep 1 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xset -display :0.0 dpms force off&amp;#34; - $USER
fi
 
grep -q open /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state
 
if [ $? = 0 ]; then
  su -c  &amp;#34;xset -display :0 dpms force on &amp;amp;&amp;gt; /tmp/screen.lid&amp;#34; - $USER
fi
EOF
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works for me.  Your results may vary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where Have I Been?</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/update-july/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Dang, no blog posts for almost six months?  What&amp;rsquo;s kept me so busy?  Japan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January I changed roles at Cisco.  I started helping on a project in Japan for Rakuten Mobile.  They are
building a cloud-native, virtualized, 5G-ready mobile network that is aiming to operate more like a web-scale
company than a telco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a mouthful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t the place to write about that, but it sure has kept me busy.  I&amp;rsquo;m in Tokyo nearly every month, usually
for a week, but the last trip was for two weeks.  I&amp;rsquo;ll write some about my experiences there later, but I do want to
comment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo is CLEAN.  Really clean.  No trash, clean sidewalks and streets.  No homeless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can go ANYWHERE on Tokyo public transit.  Seriously.  Puts everything else to shame.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo is diverse.  Compared to my last visits 10 years ago. Food, people, age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco Supervisors:  go to Tokyo. Seriously.  Go and then come back and drive on our filthy, pothole
infested, construction littered streets.  Try to use public transit.  Dodge the homeless crazy man screaming
on the corner.  Avoid stepping in the human feces.  Then maybe start to do something to fix what was once a
great City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to move to Tokyo (though my client would like me to).  But I can tell you once you really see
that a giant, complex city can be well run you REALLY get angry at seeing your own city run as a shambles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review:  Blowing up the Monolith</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Book review - free &lt;a href=&#34;https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blowing-up-the-monolith-adopting-microservices-based-architectures.pdf&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Blowing up the Monolith&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; book from Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;ldquo;Blowing up the Monolith&amp;rdquo;](&lt;a href=&#34;https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018&#34;&gt;https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
/06/blowing-up-the-monolith-adopting-microservices-based-architectures.pdf) is a short read suitable for getting an overview of how to think about moving from a large monolithic application architecture towards micro-services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;target-audience&#34;&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for any team that has an existing (legacy?) Enterprise application and are faced with the prospect of re-factoring it into a more modern architecture.  Purely from a software architecture perspective, how do you start to think about that?  This book will help set the stage.  At 22 pages though, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to do anything more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros-and-cons&#34;&gt;Pros and Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have any cons, except the fact it&amp;rsquo;s too short.  It&amp;rsquo;s a free teaser, I think, for more in depth analysis.  That said, it&amp;rsquo;s brevity is also what makes it powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, this is a short read.  It&amp;rsquo;s just over 20 page and you can read it in 30 minutes or less.  It jumps right to the point around the two main types of communication in micro-services (&amp;ldquo;service-to-service,&amp;rdquo; usually REST-like, and &amp;ldquo;asynchronous,&amp;rdquo; usually message-queue based). I like the discussion of strategies.  I&amp;rsquo;ve used both the &amp;ldquo;ice cream scoop&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;lego&amp;rdquo; strategies and both can work in the right context.  It&amp;rsquo;s useful to have terms for it.  I&amp;rsquo;ve not seen the &amp;ldquo;nuclear&amp;rdquo; strategy work.  In fact, some of my worst failures as software projects have used that approach.  Not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discussion of why not to rely on one database is very clear but I do wish it had gone into more detail about distributed databases. The libraries and security paragraphs are perhaps where I would fault the writing.  A more detailed section on authentication and especially on circuit breakers would have made this book 1000x more powerful with little more effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book barely touches the subject of containers/kubernetes (k8s). It hints at how using those technologies provides many useful features out of the box but with no detail.  This is another area that I wish the book went into more depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read this book. If you are a lead Engineer or Architect give this book to your manager.  Even if he or she isn&amp;rsquo;t all that technical (anymore?) this will give you both a common set of terms and concepts to begin to understand how to plan your journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this book were available in longer, more in-depth version I would surely pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cloudy DevOps - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/cloud-basics/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;What exactly is Cloudy DevOps?  How do you go from classic data center Enterprise deployments to the cloud?  Here&amp;rsquo;s some of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned across a half-dozen teams who&amp;rsquo;ve done it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/what-is-cloud.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have read my blog post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-devops-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;How To Do DevOps&lt;/a&gt;. You agree with the principles of aligning the goals of Dev and Ops, have those two teams work together every day, and treating Ops as a software problem.  Great principles.  But tactically speaking, what do you do to move towards DevOps in the cloud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-all-about-maturing&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s All About Maturing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you have a monolithic, Enterprise application.  It&amp;rsquo;s hosted in your data center.  You want to move to the cloud.  You want to deploy new features faster.  You want to scale up and down with your business without spending huge sums of capital up front.  You want even higher availability without paying many multiples more than you are now.  You want Cloudy DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/maturation.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has to start somewhere.  DevOps is iterative, and it&amp;rsquo;s best done in small steps.  You might be lucky enough to be doing a brand-new startup or a green field project and can start &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; but probably not.  Most likely you are where you are and you want to &amp;ldquo;get better.&amp;rdquo;  That&amp;rsquo;s the norm.  It&amp;rsquo;s like a catapillar becoming a butterfly:  it&amp;rsquo;s all about the maturation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may or may not be doing things in an agile way yet.  But that&amp;rsquo;s really the place to start.  The whole approach to getting from where you are to where you want to be is an agile one.  Pick scrum, or kanban or some merger of the two (scrumban) but head in that direction.  If you are really serious, do it right.  Scrum does not work unless you really track your delivered story points to know what your capacity is - and then actually use that to estimate time to feature delivery.  If you revert to just pushing teams to deliver against a schedule that you mandate&amp;hellip; then you are not doing scrum.  Likewise, if you are kanban then you need to actually measure your &amp;ldquo;work in progress limit&amp;rdquo; (WIP limit) and honor it.  You will need to add some form of either breaking work into similar sized chunks or using a story point approach if you want to predict when things will be done.  Setting a schedule for when you will deliver a finished software and not tracking team &amp;ldquo;feature velocity&amp;rdquo; is not agile.  If you want to do cloud DevOps, fix your agile story first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/agile.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that moving to agile gets easier as you break your system down into micro-services and take a cloud-native approach.  The more you decouple things the more you can iterate on the parts independently. The more you can make changes independently the easier it gets moving forward.  How do you move a giant mountain of dirt?  One shovel at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same approach makes sense as you move towards DevOps. It&amp;rsquo;s a process.  Do a little bit, then do a little bit more. Get better each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cloud-journey&#34;&gt;The Cloud Journey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step into cloud for most teams is the infamous &amp;ldquo;lift and shift&amp;rdquo; of existing software onto VM&amp;rsquo;s in some form of cloud.  It may be in your own datacenters on VMWare VM&amp;rsquo;s even, but that&amp;rsquo;s a start.  It moves you in the direction of virtualization.  This is a good thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s only the first baby step towards cloud.  Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, it&amp;rsquo;s still a useful step.  Many programs who want to go to the cloud and a lift and shift is the only way they can realistically get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/cloud1.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call this Cloud 1.0.  If you are using a public cloud you accomplish a huge business value of moving your infrastructure from a CapEx problem to an OpEx problem.  You don&amp;rsquo;t have to long-range capital planning for datacenter expansion because you can assume the cloud provider has virtually infinite capacity.  You do have to plan, since your finance folks will want to project costs, of course.  But it&amp;rsquo;s an operating expense now (OpEx) which essentially comes out of a different budget - one that in my experience is a lot easier to get.  Large capital expenditures seem to always involve a lot more planning and approval.  Once you lift and shift onto a cloud platform you can incrementally scale your solution and you are at least in the right environment.  But Cloud 1.0 is really just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud 2.0 is when you really start to embrace changes that will resonate into how to actually develop and deliver software.  This is perhaps the biggest change you will face because it&amp;rsquo;s a departure from everything you are used to. And that&amp;rsquo;s a bit deal.  You may not have the skills you need.  My experience is that some Dev teams know only development.  This is much more common in java shops it seems.  The things I am about to discuss definitely require linux skills.  If your teams don&amp;rsquo;t have those skills, you may need some training.  Don&amp;rsquo;t discount this.  Lack of linux skills definitely slowed down several DevOps efforts I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/skills-training.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;real-cloud-makes-everything-different---no-really&#34;&gt;Real Cloud Makes Everything Different - No REALLY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s worth saying again.  Cloud 2.0 is DIFFERENT.  There are two reasons underlying this but they have far reaching implications on your processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious first change is &amp;ldquo;infrastructure as code.&amp;rdquo;  This can really be any tool you want, really, if it translates to the creation of some combination of networking, compute, and storage that is created from running code.  This can be terraform, ansible, chef, salt, puppet, python using bodo, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/infra-as-code.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there&amp;rsquo;s a hidden secret here.  The ASSUMPTION is that if you have &amp;ldquo;infra as code&amp;rdquo; that you also have deployment automation.  That may include the same tools, or not.  For really simple things you may bake the whole application onto VM images.  I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend that for anything non-trivial because it quickly becomes hell to manage those images (build, test, store, update, delete).  So if you deploy all your infra automatically and you deploy your software and it&amp;rsquo;s configuration automatically then you can run some code and in a little while you have an instance of your whole software application running.  The benefits are many, but they include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repeatability - you get exactly the same setup every time you run the code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;source control - put that code under source control (like git) and manage it like code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;inspectability - unlike GUI operations, you can have a second set of eyes review it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sharability - you can share the code between teams, building on others successes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;recoverability - you can rebuild identical infra somewhere else if a catastrophe happens&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need a good Disaster Recovery (DR) plan anyway, and if you are this point then you can put something in place that actually works.  You can choose to use the cloud provider&amp;rsquo;s proprietary solution or use something open source, but the point is just to DO IT.  I highly recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34;&gt;terraform&lt;/a&gt; for this though. While your scripts do end up being specific to the cloud vendor, but at least it&amp;rsquo;s readable code.  I draw distinction here between cloud infra orchestration systems (like terraform or AWS Cloud Formation or Azure Resource Manager) and Configuration Management solutions like chef, puppet or ansible.  If you are not already familiar with all these I recommend you stop now and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thorntech.com/2018/04/15-infrastructure-as-code-tools/&#34;&gt;go read up on them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical scenario uses terraform to create the infra and then either chef, puppet, ansible or salt to deploy and configure the software. The details on what is installed on a given host is usually specified as part of the cloud init process.  This is somewhat specific to the cloud vendor.  AWS does it &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html&#34;&gt;this way&lt;/a&gt; and Azure does it a&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/cloudinit-bash-script&#34;&gt; similar way&lt;/a&gt;.  Terraform abstracts that away to be mostly common but you should really &lt;a href=&#34;http://darylscorner.com/2016/11/using-terraform-across-multiple-cloud-providers/&#34;&gt;learn how&lt;/a&gt;.  And there are gotchas, according to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dzone.com/articles/multi-cloud-gotchas-with-aws-azure-and-hashicorp&#34;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;.  The point is that you should avoid creating custom VM images because managing them becomes massively painful, and when you need to use them you are copying or moving hundreds of gigabyte images over the cloud network.  Nothing happens fast that way.  If you use terraform to boot a standard image and pass in the right cloud init data to trigger your configuration management then you can automatically deploy everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot emphasize this enough.  Deployment automation is the first and most important part of doing real cloud.  You will be tempted to get close to full automation and some small part of another will be difficult and you will think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s OK, I&amp;rsquo;ll just do that part manually.&amp;rdquo;  Don&amp;rsquo;t do it.  Don&amp;rsquo;t let that little devil on your shoulder tempt you that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/devil-on-shoulder.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finish the job. Be able to deploy your whole solution by running a script. If your solution deploys it&amp;rsquo;s own database then you also have to run the scripts to at least create your schemas, or to recover a database backup that has a known set of data or a recent backup of your data.  This is the holy grail:  to be able to deploy your whole software solution to the cloud by running a script and passing it some data (like which database backup to use, for example).  When you get to this point, you can celebrate.  You have hit a milestone in Cloudy DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you are not done.  Even more important than the code to create and deploy the infrastructure and software is the code to DELETE the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/disposal-automation.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important concept here is DISPOSABILITY.  If you can create it from code, you can delete it from code.  Poof!  It&amp;rsquo;s gone.  This should be part and parcel of what you did to test your creation scripts.  Create.  Test and verify.  Destroy.  Repeat and ensure it&amp;rsquo;s the same, every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to destroy the resources is even more important than the ability to create it.  Stop for a minute and think.  Why is that more important?  There&amp;rsquo;s two big reasons.  The smaller reason is money.  I&amp;rsquo;ve seen teams create lots and lots of infrastructure and then not turn it off and the next thing you know you are spending $300K per quarter and the finance people get really unhappy.  Build the discipline to create and then destroy it after you&amp;rsquo;ve used it.  But the bigger reason is the workflow that gets enabled out of dynamic creation and destruction of infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This changes everything.  You now completely decouple Engineers working on one part of your solution from dependencies on Engineers working on other parts.  Team A can deploy version 1 with some changes they are working on and they can develop and test to their hearts content - and then destroy the whole thing a few hours later.  For less money than a few pizzas cost your team can make huge progress on things that previously dependent on other teams.  Not only that, your testing/QA efforts can proceed independently.  Want to do regression testing against a specific version of code and a specific version of your database?  Deploy that combination and test, and turn it all off by dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/pizzas.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously.  This is the single most important step you can take.  Well, other than actually having automated tests.  You do have those right?  That&amp;rsquo;s just good software practice and not specific to Cloudy DevOps, but you do need it to really make the next step sing. If you can automatically instantiate cloud servers and deploy and configure your software, and you can automatically run tests against it, then you have the logo blocks you need to start the next stage of the cloud journey.  You can start to think about Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).  You have the blocks in place to really start taking your software apart and breaking it into components, reworking it towards micro-services.  You can really start thinking about containers (if you didn&amp;rsquo;t already start there up above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create, test, destroy.  Sounds almost biblical.  But it&amp;rsquo;s the foundation for Cloudy DevOps. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to get there if your starting point is old-school Enterprise software development.  But you don&amp;rsquo;t need to boil the ocean.  You can make incremental progress.  It reminds me of the admittedly apocryphal story of what Michelangelo said when he was asked how he sculpted his famous statue David.  He supposedly said &amp;ldquo;well, I carved away everything that didn&amp;rsquo;t look like David.&amp;rdquo;  You can do the same thing with DevOps.  Stop doing all the things that don&amp;rsquo;t look like DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cloud-images/david.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up:  talking about Ops and how your mind-set needs to change to start to really make DevOps work for you.  Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Self Driving Revolution</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/self-driving-revolution/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 10 Feb 2019 09:00:29 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/self-driving-revolution/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Think self-driving technology requires deep pockets to play with?  Think again.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/&#34;&gt;AWS DeepRacer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki&#34;&gt;Autoware&lt;/a&gt; are the leading edges of self-driving automation for the maker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/&#34;&gt;AWS DeepRacer&lt;/a&gt; is a low-cost, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ros.org/&#34;&gt;ROS-based&lt;/a&gt; robotic card that uses machine learning (reinforcement learning) and it&amp;rsquo;s camera-input to drive courses it&amp;rsquo;s been &amp;ldquo;trained&amp;rdquo; to drive.  With the online simulator, this tool can get you started developing self-driving cars &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/AWS-DeepRacer-Fully-autonomous-developers/dp/B07JMHRKQG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1549816067&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=deep+racer&#34;&gt;for under $400.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autoware.ai/&#34;&gt;Autoware&lt;/a&gt; is the world&amp;rsquo;s first &amp;ldquo;All-in-One&amp;rdquo; open-source software for autonomous driving technology. It is based on ROS 1 and available under the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/wiki&#34;&gt;Apache 2.0 license on github.&lt;/a&gt;  It &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware#recommended-system-specifications&#34;&gt;requires&lt;/a&gt; 8 cores and 32GB of RAM so it&amp;rsquo;s not going to run on a Raspberry Pi.  It supports camera, LIDAR, IMU and GPS inputs.  Those compute and sensor requirements are going to be a lot more than the DeepRacer, but I&amp;rsquo;m guessing you could build something in the $1000 range that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important thing is that there&amp;rsquo;s a starting point for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/deepracer.jpg&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/autoware.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here in San Francisco we see self-driving enabled cars on the road a lot. Many of them are annoying as hell since they make driving decisions much more slowly than humans do.  Geeks among us think &amp;ldquo;damn, how hard is really to decide the cross-walk is empty!&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s easy to think that you need the cash of a VC-backed startup to really start playing with that tech.  Not so.  It&amp;rsquo;s still pricey:  $400 for the DeepRacer and likely $1000-1500 for a proper Autoware robot.  But the tooling is there if you have a bit of money, at least some background in coding, and the time and energy to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ripe for Innovation!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;imagination&#34;&gt;Imagination&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a DeepRacer and have another on order.  I bought one within minutes of it being announced at AWS re:Invent &lt;a href=&#34;http://herlein.com/post/avalanche-reinvent/&#34;&gt;(I blogged about that at the time).&lt;/a&gt;  I have one sitting here in my home office and only lack the time to play with it.  I got lucky enough to be invited by AWS to a four-hour solo-focus-session where an AWS CX person watched me unbox and learn to set it up.  It was a bit strange to be under the microscope, but I think I gave them some good feedback and I got to keep the DeepRacer that I unboxed.  Win-win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/amazon-aws-deepracer-interior.jpg&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;480&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I am extremely excited about is the fact that the DeepRacer tool is based on Robot Operating System - ROS.  And it&amp;rsquo;s not all locked out either.  AWS is not hiding the guts.  It&amp;rsquo;s an Ubuntu board with and Atom CPU and 4GB of RAM &lt;a href=&#34;https://imgur.com/a/m4ymiYH&#34;&gt;(specs here)&lt;/a&gt;.  You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepRacer/comments/a47ka2/its_pretty_easy_by_design_to_get_into_ubuntu_on/?utm_source=reddit-android&#34;&gt;develop right on the car main node&lt;/a&gt;.  The main code seems to be in python interfacing with ROS.  So this seems extremely hackable.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://hackaday.com/tag/deepracer/&#34;&gt;Hackaday&lt;/a&gt; is postulating alternative hardware even, so this ecosystem is about to explode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last few days I came across Autoware.  It&amp;rsquo;s non-trivial and is being used as the basis for commercial offerings already, so it&amp;rsquo;s real.  It looks reasonably modularized.  Being based on ROS is almost certainly all written in C++ so it&amp;rsquo;s probably reasonably performant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/autoware_overview.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the hardware requirements this is probably a bit harder to set up and the bug-a-boo will be I/O bandwidth I am sure.  USB webcams are the obvious choice for cameras but can you do multiple cameras at once?  May need USB3, which means you are not even going to use an Intel Nuc for this.  The GPS is easy over USB, and you could make a USB adapter for a 9DoF IMU pretty easily.  I was reading about a module that a guy built that did the sensor fusion on the board and had one-degree heading accuracy for under $75 if I recall.  I&amp;rsquo;ll try to look that up and revise this post later with a link.  You would think it would be the LIDAR that was the harder sensor to deal with, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of options for that.   &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.adafruit.com/product/4010?gclid=Cj0KCQiAtP_iBRDGARIsAEWJA8hC-BFONYtcV8nD-f9n0T2MXtqcXlw579h3ISa98NP3p48gKUUz_X0aAuuXEALw_wcB&#34;&gt;Adafruit sells an intersting scanning LIDAR for $114.&lt;/a&gt;  Sparkfun has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/lidar-lite-v3-hookup-guide/all&#34;&gt;non-rotating unit.&lt;/a&gt; as well as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14756&#34;&gt;rotating one&lt;/a&gt;, granted more expensive at $320.  My point is that there are many options out there.  You might have to tweak some of the Autoware code - or more likely, the underlying ROS libraries - to make it work but the products are there to be integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/autoware_demo.png&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building blocks are there.  Damn, I wish I had more time!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RBOT Robotics Sensor/Acuator Board - Value Proposition</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/rbot-value-prop/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2019 13:40:08 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m building a board for robotics, but it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for IoT and home automation.  What&amp;rsquo;s it do?  What problem does it solve?  It&amp;rsquo;s basically a WiFi interface to a variety of I2C-driven devices (motors or sensors).  The I2C side is Engineered to be highly robust and reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rbot&#34;&gt;RBOT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RBOT platform is aimed at folks doing robotics - but it&amp;rsquo;s also easily used for IoT and home automation.  One of my core values is the strong desire for this to be a means for learning and education, so it&amp;rsquo;s an open platform and open source solution.  Electronics hobbyists can extend it because it&amp;rsquo;s open.  Software hobbyists can purchase kits to just use it without knowing much about the hardware. Makers can do both!  More importantly it&amp;rsquo;s an easy to use, SOFTWARE FIRST robotics kit suitable for middle-school through Junior College educational use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a work in progress.  Consider it a vision more than a real product spec. I definitely expect that as I progress it will change.  Once real users start to use RBOT it will definitely morph again.  I am taking a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.market-by-numbers.com/customer-development/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;customer development&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; approach to this.  I am currently in the Customer Discovery phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-platform-for-learning&#34;&gt;A Platform for Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top three problems being solved are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide a SOFTWARE FIRST kit/platform for robotics suitable for education and learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable robotics learning and education from ANY coding language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid proprietary, closed solutions and embrace the revolution in maker technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using sensors is key to doing anything interesting in robotics, IoT and home automation. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to wire up an typical I2C/SMB two-wire sensor to a few pins on an Arduino and you have a sensor and you can write some code in the Arduino IDE to do something.  There&amp;rsquo;s even a few robotics kits built around that.  But try to use five or six sensors at once.  Not so easy.  Want to do it in python?  Hmmm.  Want to build your own sensor and then use it?  Double hmmm.  You run into problems.  Using multiple I2C sensors means understanding the I2C addressing, and then even if you avoid address conflicts you can add a device in parallel - I2C is a bus, after all - and suddenly nothing works anymore.  Groan.  If what you really want to do is play with the software side of robotics anyway suddenly you are trapped in hardware hell and you likely don&amp;rsquo;t have the tools to solve what&amp;rsquo;s wrong.  You likely need an Oscilloscope and a some electronics knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, if you want to focus on the software side and just follow the Arduino postings and cut and paste code in the Arduino IDE that&amp;rsquo;s cool, but you are then limited to the power of the Arduino controller you are using and doing any kind of concurrent programming on Arduino is essentially impossible for the non-expert (and even then, most coders I know could not pull of multi-threading in Arduino). How do you interface that to something off the Arduino?  You start moving up the food chain and thinking ESP32, but now you are stuck back in low level C or very limited python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBOT solves these problems by providing a central device hub that you connect to over WiFi.  It lets you use up to eight (8) &amp;ldquo;smart RBOT devices&amp;rdquo; and another eight (8) simple digitial inputs - all at the same time, all in real-time and in parallel.  The best part is that you can access all the devices and their data over WiFi using a simple-to-use API. The RBOT board uses an inexpensive ESP32 daughterboard ($8 currently) programmed with the open source RBOT firmware that abstracts all the hardware complexity from the developer. The source code for the ESP32 is open source, so you can change it if you want to.  Or you can just use it, plug and play, and concentrate on writing robotics code.  Using a set of initial RBOT devices - a motor, some sensors - you can plug them in and start building code to make it go within minutes.  And you can use whatever language you want, from whatever device you want.  Use your phone!  Use your notebook! Use a Raspberry Pi operating as an embedded controller!  In any language that supports networking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, because the whole RBOT spec is open it allows development of new sensor and actuator applications.  You can use Arduino tooling and boards and make your own new custom sensor, or dive deep into more advanced embedded system design and drive the cost out of your connected RBOT device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in short:  it&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;PLATFORM FOR LEARNING ROBOTICS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-am-i-building-rbot&#34;&gt;Why am I Building RBOT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my career I have used a number of sensor systems as a user and developer.  I was a Nuclear-trained Electronics Technician in the Navy (served in submarines), when I fell in love with instrumentation and control systems - especially for complex systems (like a submarine nuclear reactor).  After the Navy I worked for an R&amp;amp;D lab for 5 years (at PG&amp;amp;E, before California stupidly de-regulated) where we built remote sensing applications for gas and power systems.  I worked as the on-board Engineering support for the folks who found the Titanic:  Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) where I was responsible for all the non-shipping sensors and systems and supported the data and video systems on the deep diving submarine Alvin.  As a Software Engineer and at various levels of management I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in internet telephony, internet video, smart TV data systems, and complext network data collection systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also coached middle-school and high-school robotics for the last 7 years where I have seen many educational robotics systems first hand for what they can, and cannot do.  Today&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc&#34;&gt;FIRST&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vexrobotics.com/competition&#34;&gt;VEX&lt;/a&gt; systems are amazing, powerful, educational and fun.  But they are primarily MECHANICAL FIRST approaches that focus on REMOTE CONTROL.  The new VEX compiler suite is so much better, for sure&amp;hellip; but it&amp;rsquo;s still limited to one fairly limited controller programmed either in their C++ or their non-technical block language.  FIRST allows use of Java but again, it&amp;rsquo;s a closed ecosystem.  Kids in high school should be learning python, or even golang!  The AP Computer Science courses have a huge emphasis on javascript.  Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t a robotics system allow a creative teacher to link those classes to sensing and moving in the real world?  Of course.  And that&amp;rsquo;s the drive behind RBOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RBOT vision is to provide a SOFTWARE FIRST kit and platform.  Connectors and the core device technology should be easily obtainable, open standard, and open source.  If you want to put a sensor five feet from the micro-controller you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to buy some special, over-priced cable when a normal Ethernet cable will do the trick nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-will-i-have-to-buy&#34;&gt;What Will I Have to Buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing, if you really want to make it all yourself.  Some folks will want that.  Most will be happy to buy an RBOT Main Board and some core sensors and actuators.  If we do this right, there&amp;rsquo;s be a marketplace where creative roboticists can make and sell their own additional sensors and actuators, especially as newer chips and sensors, and smaller motors become available.  If it makes it&amp;rsquo;s way into flight or undersea bots, then all the better!  Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ll sell RBOT hardware and I&amp;rsquo;ll need to make a profit of some kind to recoup the investment I&amp;rsquo;ve made.  But unlike some other systems, we don&amp;rsquo;t aim to lock anyone into a specific proprietary solution.  I think we can do just fine with an open approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-the-connection-to-vex&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the Connection to VEX?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None, except that I coach VEX team 8255 at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory in San Francisco.  As such we have thousands of dollars of VEX parts and my students are my first testers.  We just upgraded to the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexedr/v5&#34;&gt;VEX v5&lt;/a&gt; control system.  One downside of this is that it cannot use the old motors and batteries.  So I plan to make lemonade from that lemon and early RBOT devices will allow you to use older VEX 293 motors and motor controllers and shaft encoders.  Waste not, want not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;frequently-asked-questions&#34;&gt;Frequently Asked Questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in question and answers, and sometimes the best way to quickly share a lot of information is through that format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why do I need RBOT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to learn robotics with a SOFTWARE FIRST mentality!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to use multiple I2C sensors and actuators and not be bound by a specific micro-controller or platform choice (e.g. Arduino) this device abstracts away all the I2C problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I interface to RBOT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBOT is a WiFi device that can easily be configured to join an existing WiFi network or act as an Access Point (AP).  It uses standard &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zeroconf.org/&#34;&gt;ZeroConf&lt;/a&gt; to easily allow discovery.  It exposes a rich API that enabled enumerating what devices are plugged in to the board and to then read and control those devices using simple APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What network devices inter-operate with RBOT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any device that works on a WiFi network, or on an Ethernet network that can connect to a WiFi network that the RBOT is connected to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What programming languages do I need to use to interoperate with RBOT?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any language that supports networking, which is pretty much all of them.  You pick.  Examples will be available in at least a few common languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would a common RBOT application look like?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have a simple robot that you can control with your phone or notebook directly.  You might have a more complex robot that has an onboard processor like a Raspberry Pi or Beagleboard that is programmed to control RBOT using it&amp;rsquo;s API&amp;rsquo;s.  The choice is yours.  RBOT is a building block that abstracts device complexity away from the software developer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why would I need many sensors and actuators?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example simple robot would need two motors, maybe two shaft encoders, maybe one or more ultrasonic transducers, a 9-axis IMU, and a color sensor for line following, as an example.  That&amp;rsquo;s at least 6 sensors.  If the robot was 2 foot square wiring those to the &amp;ldquo;brain&amp;rdquo; means a lot of individual wires and some potential problems because of that.  One is from I2C/SMB address collision, and the other is from wiring capacitance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s address collision?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Today an I2C bus is that - a bus.  Every device on a single bus needs it&amp;rsquo;s own unique address.  Some I2C devices let you change their address, but keeping track of that is confusing and limited - and you might want to use more devices than the chip allows unique addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s wiring capacitance?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wiring a bus of I2C devices adds significant capacitance for each device in parallel and leads to &amp;ldquo;rounding&amp;rdquo; of the data pulses and failed communication.  This is very hard to troubleshoot even with an I2C sniffer.  You need an oscilloscope, which is not a tool many of our target users will have available to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;But can I have many of the same device?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.  Since RBOT is a switch each port is on it&amp;rsquo;s own electrically separate &amp;ldquo;bus&amp;rdquo; so no messing with I2C addresses is needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real-world sensors need to be remote to where processing is - perhaps many tens of feet away.  Does this solve that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes,  you connect your sensor to the RBOT using normal Cat5 (or better) Ethernet cable - tens of meters if need be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sensors need power.  Does this solve that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.  The RBOT takes 6-15VDC in through a standard center-pin jack.  An onboard regulator provides 3.3VDC for the controller daughter board and sensor power.  Each sensor port pinout supplies two voltages - board 3V3 for sensor power and board VCC for actuator power so your remote sensor or actuator is easily powered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Actuators need more than 3 volts,  Does this solve that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes.  The RBOT sensor port pinout supplies board VCC at up to 600mA on each port, wired on the same pins used for Power over Ethernet.  Board VCC can be any voltage between 6-15VDC supplied by a standard power plug just like on an Arduino.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do sensors need to use board VCC?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No.  If a sensor does not need board VCC then those pins are not even connected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What exactly is an actuator?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
* Actuators are usually small motors or servoes.   RBOT allows a single Ethernet cable to control a &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; motor over I2C/SMB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does RBOT know what&amp;rsquo;s plugged in?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
* Yes.  RBOT uses a &amp;ldquo;hot plug detect&amp;rdquo; scheme to know if a device is plugged into a port, which triggers the software to probe it automatically.  It then builds a &amp;ldquo;port map&amp;rdquo; of what is plugged in and exposes that information over an API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What sensors and actuators can I use?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBOT will support a few options at launch with more over time - but the system is open source and openly expandable with sensor code, schematics and boards published.  We aim to support at least a basic smart motor, ultrasonic transducer, color sensor, and 9-DOF IMU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can I design my own sensors or actuators?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yes, off course, that&amp;rsquo;s the point.  You can add sensors and then plug in code to expose that sensor into the open source RBOT switch code.  We will have simple breakout boards for that use case, but you can just use perf board if you want since a sensor has very few wires and components.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the Digital Input Ports for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simply reading a contact closure does not need to use an entire I2C/SMB ports.  These ports use less expensive RJ-11 (phone cable) connectors and supply 3.3V and feed into the digital inputs.  They also support hot plug detect so the RBOT knows which ones are plugged in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why not just use Grove Connectors?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grove connectors are cool, but they are proprietary.  We aimed to make everything easily available and industry standard.  We think that the easy ability to make custom-length RJ-45 Ethernet cables (or RJ-11 cables for digital inputs) is an overwhelmingly better option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What can I build with this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RBOT was designed for robotics, but is flexible enough to support IoT, home automation, and a wide range of interesting applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;example-sensors-and-actuators&#34;&gt;Example Sensors and Actuators&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color Sensor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCS34735 color sensor.  Wire it up with one resistor on a small board with an Ethernet jack and put the color reading chip right where you need it.  One an example line follower robot you probably need two of these positioned to read the floor, spaced about half as wide as the line you intend to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_ 9-DOF IMU_&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MPU-9250 is an example of this.  Wire  it up with one resistor on a small board with an Ethernet jack and put the sensor right where it makes sense for your robot - probably direct centerline with the x, y and z axes positioned properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_ Smart Motor_&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an off-the-shelf motor and I2C/SMB driver chip on a board and power the motor right from board VCC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_ VEX EDR 293 and Shaft-Encoder &amp;ldquo;Smart Motor&amp;rdquo;_&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the release of the VEX v5 many teams took advantage of the swap program, returning their old EDR brains.  The new v5 uses it&amp;rsquo;s own smart motor.  Many teams will have piles of older 293 motors and shaft encoders laying about.  A simple low cost controller to interface I2C and to drive a speed controller and read two lines from the encoder and you have a &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; interface that lets educational programs keep using their older investment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart Ultrasonic Transducer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple low cost controller to interface I2C and to drive the transducers and you have a range sensor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use your Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be providing example code and breakout boards for both digital inputs and sensor/actuator devices.  We will open source all our sensor boards so makers will have plenty of examples and tools to work from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visuals!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m building a robotics board that basically is a WiFi REST interface to a variety of I2C sensors - the I2C side uses an I2C switch driven by an ESP32. My first RBOT board arrived, but alas, I got schooled on surface mount part numbering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My order of three blank RBOT boards arrived.  I set aside this morning to solder all the surface mount parts onto the first one.  Alas, I got schooled.  Seems to be a theme these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/blank-board.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a learning experience for me.  The last board I laid out was 25 years ago and it was all through-hole parts.  For RBOT I am using Eagle for schematic capture and board layout. It&amp;rsquo;s not like space is at a huge premium on my early boards but I did want to build experience with surface mount (SMD).  I picked 0603 resistors and caps. I had researched parts using &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.findchips.com/&#34;&gt;FindChips&lt;/a&gt; but actually ordered through &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mouser.com/&#34;&gt;Mouser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t know to look for was that there are 0603 sized parts in both inches (in) and millimeters (mm).  And, true to the rule of 50-50-90(*) I ordered the mm when Eagle used in.  Have you seen 0603 mm parts?  I almost CANNOT see them they are so small - way too small for the board I laid out.  Cheap lesson though since ordering the right parts was only $16 with shipping.  But now I have to wait, and I lose a holiday day that I could have been soldering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead I shifted gears to the other side of the puzzle:  the sensor/actuator boards. I basically provide a standard 8-pin pinout over Ethernet that provides board main voltage (which is 6-15VDC, intended to be battery main voltage), 3.3VDC for sensor power, and the SDA and SDC lines for I2C.  The idea is to make it super easy to add a motor or a sensor and wire it with a short length of Ethernet cable.  I&amp;rsquo;ll be blogging about my design later, but Ethernet is far better than telephone cable since it can actually support at least 60W of power delivery if you follow the Power-over-Ethernet specs.  More importantly the capacitance of the insulation on the wires is far, far lower which makes I2C much more reliable even at many feet of distance.  And with Ethernet cables you can make your own - no need to buy proprietary connectors (like Grove).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my core product philosophies is that I want folks to be able to hack/extend/make things that extend my system. That&amp;rsquo;s why I picked Ethernet cables for example.  Some good friends have emphasized that even if I provide sensors that are cost-optimized that it would be ideal if I also provided some example devices that were Arduino based.  This would make them much more approachable.  This fits with my philosophy:  I want to make a robotics/sensor platform that makes it easy to solve the painful parts and get to where you can write code sooner.  Power and multiple I2C sensors, and multi-threading are severe impediments to really making more complex robotics using affordable off-the-shelf parts.  But RBOT devices still need to be affordable and at least relatively small, so mainstream Arduino is out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/pro-mini-size.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I bought a few &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Q9YAP2E/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;Pro Mini boards&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon - $16.88 for three with free shipping.  It wasn&amp;rsquo;t until later I found some &lt;a href=&#34;https://robotdyn.com/promini-atmega328p.html&#34;&gt;much cheaper ones&lt;/a&gt; for $2.29 each but the shipping from China would be slow or expensive or both.  Amazon Prime is your friend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I blew up the DTR input circuit on the first one I connected. Uploading a simple &amp;ldquo;blink&amp;rdquo; sketch from the Arduiono IDE didn&amp;rsquo;t work unless I pressed the reset button.  Pulling out my scope probles I proved to myself that DTR was always low when it should have been high.  Initially I thought it was my tty port (new Linux install) but some &amp;ldquo;stty&amp;rdquo; probing proved me wrong.  Trying two other USB programmer units gave the same result.  So now I had two different FTDI units and a CP2102 unit both with the same symptoms.  Trying a second of the three Pro Mini boards was normal. DTR should have been high and go low but it stayed low all the time. Maybe the input capacitor on DTR shorted to ground?  The schematic I have shows no way that could happen, but who knows if my schematic actually matches this Gikfun clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, problem solved and now instead of soldering surface mount things today I&amp;rsquo;ll instead be writing some Arduinio I2C client side code with &lt;a href=&#34;http://dsscircuits.com/articles/arduino-i2c-slave-guide&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point.  Because now I have to wait for parts.  Instant gratification must wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50-50-90 rule:  in any 50-50 chance situation you&amp;rsquo;ll be wrong 90% of the time.  Old saying from my Navy submariner days.  Meaning don&amp;rsquo;t leave things to chance.  Know the answer, don&amp;rsquo;t guess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ubuntu Again!</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-18.04/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Jan 2019 08:40:43 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/ubuntu-18.04/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;From 1997 to 2010 I believed it was only a matter of time before Linux on the desktop
became a reality.  I gave up in 2010 and went to OSX.  But we may finally be close!
Here&amp;rsquo;s my notes on installing Linux Ubuntu 18.04 on a Dell Inspiron 15 7000.  It&amp;rsquo;s
the easiest and happiest linux ever for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/new-inspiron-15-7000/spd/inspiron-15-7580-laptop&#34;&gt;Dell Inspiron 15 7000&lt;/a&gt; that I use for Linux development work.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been
using it for my Eagle schematic capture and board layout work too.  When I bought it
I was not looking to break the bank since I was mostly an OSX user but I wanted a
decent portable Linux machine.  I like it since it has a reasonably fast CPU (quad-core i5-7300HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz), easily accessible ports to add your own RAM and extra SSD, and a passable GPU (NVIDIA GeForce MX150 2GB GDDR5).  Most importantly it has a 15.6in screen
(my eyes need that) and an external HDMI port.  I mostly use it on a KVM, but once
in awhile I take it somewhere with me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend this notebook.  The keyboard is terrible to
type on.  The layout is just&amp;hellip; off.  The keys are just not right.  I love the
backlighting though.  Nice on a dark airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had installed Linux Mint on it a few years ago since Ubuntu&amp;rsquo;s Unity desktop just made me gag.  I had tried it and just hated it. I thought at the time that Ubuntu was just trying to make it TOO simple, and to make it behave how I wanted I needed more control - and that control was painful to do.  I ended up using the XFCE desktop mostly because it was easy to configure things the way I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fast-forward&#34;&gt;Fast Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to modernize my OS and there were digital barnacles growing all over.  You know, the cruft of libraries installed to make some package work back 2 years ago that
subtely play havoc behind the scenes.  And packages that made sense at the time but
now need older libraries.  Nothing was BROKEN, per se&amp;hellip; but it was not clean and
happy either.  I&amp;rsquo;m spoiled you see.  When you work with cloud servers and you
have full automation for all package installs then you get used to never having ANY
cruft on your system.  Cruft is yucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d heard good things about Ubuntu 18.04 so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give it another try.  I
downloaded the ISO and burned it to a USB stick.  Speaking of cruft, you can get
digital bit rot in hardware too.  My first thumb drive worked OK but installed a
corrupted image and I pulled my hair out for a bit before I figured that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;usb-woes&#34;&gt;USB Woes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I&amp;rsquo;m a command line guy.  So I naturally use &amp;ldquo;dd&amp;rdquo; to make bootable ISO
images on a USB.  I did that from my linux notebook and then used it to install
Ubuntu.  But once I suspected I had a bad burn, I&amp;rsquo;d already wiped the notebook.
Luckily I had a MBP handy and I decided to use that.  Ubuntu recommends
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.balena.io/etcher/&#34;&gt;Etcher&lt;/a&gt; so I tried that.  And that is how I found
I had a bad USB thumb drive.  Etcher does a validation step and it kept failing.
So into the bin with that drive and I had to rummage around for another.  Funny
thing, USB sticks.  They walk away!  The only one I could find was a 16GB, which
I used.  But I want that back for normal use so I bought &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BKQ9BVV/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;five 8GB sticks
from Amazon for $15&lt;/a&gt;.  Prime, two day free delivery. So cheap compared to the
last time I bought them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, use something like Etcher, or validate your burn.  I have to figure out
how to do that at the Linux command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dell-woes&#34;&gt;Dell Woes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remembered that I had to jump through some hoops getting Mint installed a few years
back but I stupidly didn&amp;rsquo;t blog about it or keep notes.  The real reason I am
writing this is for self documentation, but if it helps someone else then great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, remember to go into the BIOS (hit F12 repeatedly as you power on) and
turn off secure boot.  Keep UEFI though - legacy boot will fail.  Then boot, but
catch it at the GRUB screen (black screen, tiny white letters, white line border)
and down arrow to &amp;ldquo;Install Linux&amp;rdquo; and hit &amp;ldquo;e&amp;rdquo; to edit the boot parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not really for the faint of heart.  It&amp;rsquo;s too hard for the average
person.  But honestly it was the hardest part of the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option that worked for me I found on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2390403&#34;&gt;Ubuntu Forums&lt;/a&gt;.  All I needed to do was add the following to the kernel
parameters list (the line with vmlinuz in it) at the end:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;acpi_osi=
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then hit Ctrl-x and let it boot.  Bingo.  It installed.  But that&amp;rsquo;s not all.&lt;br&gt;
To make that permanent, once you have the install done but before you reboot
you need to go in and edit /etc/default/grub file and and add the same
thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=&amp;#34;acpi_osi=&amp;#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then run the config utility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;update-grub
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it.  At least for me. It forces the ACPI system to be &amp;ldquo;generic&amp;rdquo; and
that lets things work OK for Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;distress-but-hope&#34;&gt;Distress but Hope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A newbie would NEVER have figured this out.  We won&amp;rsquo;t get Linux on the Desktop
with this kind of crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Dell in particular is really trying.  You can buy an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/cty/pdp/spd/xps-13-9370-laptop/cax13w10p2c601ubuntus&#34;&gt;excellent
notebook with Linux preinstalled&lt;/a&gt; that gets &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-xps-13-the-best-linux-laptop-of-2018/&#34;&gt;great reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge reason I bought the Dell Inspiron in the first place was Dell&amp;rsquo;s commitment
to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ok-finally-about-ubuntu-1804&#34;&gt;OK, Finally&amp;hellip; About Ubuntu 18.04&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the best Linux I have ever used.  Hands down.  The new GNOME3 desktop at
first was so similar to Unity that I almost just turned it off and went back to Mint.
But I persevered and I&amp;rsquo;m very glad I did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of my issues are cosmetic.  I want the launch panel at the bottom.  I use a LOT
of terminal consoles (I&amp;rsquo;m typing this in one now - I&amp;rsquo;m a CLI guy, remember?) and I
am very picky about their automatic size and position.  But the biggest issue is
that I am VERY picky about key bindings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key bindings are &amp;ldquo;hot keys&amp;rdquo; that do things for you. I live in the terminal, hands
on my keyboard.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to lift my hand to get the mouse, unless I
need to cut and paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happily, right under Settings is Devices, and then Keyboards, and then a
ridiculously simple way to set many of the desired behaviors.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t even
have to google for anything.  No weird right-click, set the attributes with
a special incantation things even.  Just easy as pie configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Ubuntu 18.04 so far.  I have not yet found something that I don&amp;rsquo;t like
that I can&amp;rsquo;t configure away pretty simply.  At this point, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure
I could live and work all day in this environment.  Everything &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo;
at least so far.  Having fought for hours with WiFi, audio, HDMI, etc. on
Linux on notebooks over the years I can tell you it&amp;rsquo;s a delight to just
have things actually work with no tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, there is one thing.  No iMessages.  As I write this my friend Phil is
&amp;ldquo;texting&amp;rdquo; me on iMessage and I&amp;rsquo;m answering him on my phone.  ON MY PHONE.  Not
using the iMessage app on my desktop with my real keyboard that I type really
fast with.  ON MY PHONE.  Picking my hads up off the keyboard.  Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux has come amazingly far in the 25 years I have used it.  It&amp;rsquo;s clearly
the most prevalent OS on the planet (nearly all cloud servers, all Android
phones, most firewalls, all Chromebooks).  It has never become the Desktop
that I could just love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we may be close.

      <title>ESP32-PICO-KIT-V4 Eagle Library</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32-pico-v4-library/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2018 10:33:02 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/esp32-pico-v4-library/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;An Eagle part library to support use of the ESP32-PICO-KIT-V4 as a daughterboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on a &amp;ldquo;device hub&amp;rdquo; for robotics and remote sensing.  The goal is to provide a hub for I2C devices
(motors, actuators and sensors) that&amp;rsquo;s accessible over WiFi.  The board will be low-cost, powered from 12VDC (nominal)
power supply or battery, and expose a range of devices over the network via a clean, simple abstraction API.  I&amp;rsquo;m
calling this project RBOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;autodesk-eagle&#34;&gt;Autodesk Eagle&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m using the fantastic &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview&#34;&gt;Eagle software&lt;/a&gt; from Autodesk.
It&amp;rsquo;s free for small board development and pretty cheap for professional development.  There&amp;rsquo;s LOTS of parts
already available for this software, including many for the ESP32.  But for what I want to do I could not find
a suitable part library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;esp-board-as-a-daughter-board&#34;&gt;ESP Board as a Daughter Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/get-started-pico-kit.html&#34;&gt;ESP32-Pico-V4 Board&lt;/a&gt; is
about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/espressif-systems/ESP32-PICO-KIT/1904-1030-ND/9381703&#34;&gt;$8 at DigiKey&lt;/a&gt;
making it a fabulous, cheap, easy to use compute daughterboard for projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s far cheaper to buy one of these and drop it into a socket on a custom board than to try to source all the parts and
have the ESP32 compute parts right on your board.  Besides, the BOM cost to add those components would DEFINITELY add
up to more than $8!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-not-the-esp32-thing-from-sparkfun&#34;&gt;Why Not the ESP32 Thing from SparkFun?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have one of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13907&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; boards too, but they are $21 not $8.  Also, as a
daughterboard you probably don&amp;rsquo;t need the battery charging circuit, and they use a 26MHz main crystal frequency, not 40MHz
like the PICO-V4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-actual-library&#34;&gt;The Actual Library&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install it yourself by &amp;ldquo;git clone&amp;rdquo; into your $EAGLE/library folder from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/esp32-boards&#34;&gt;gitub repo&lt;/a&gt;.
You will need to add the library as usual, then make sure you &amp;ldquo;use&amp;rdquo; it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;actual-physical-parts&#34;&gt;Actual Physical Parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board mounts on a 2x20 header pair 0.7in apart.  The &amp;ldquo;bottom&amp;rdquo; 3 pins on each side are not populated (bottom is where
the antenna is, top is where the USB Connection is).  I had a hard time finding 1x20 headers but finally found some from
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.peconnectors.com/female-headers-pcb-1x-row-.100/hws15775/&#34;&gt;Pheonix Enterprises&lt;/a&gt; for $0.68 (x1).  I definitely would not be able
to find 17 pin headers (although you could cut your own).  So be careful when you insert the actual board into the socket to
line pin 1 and 20 up to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;power-supply-considerations&#34;&gt;Power Supply Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/get-started-pico-kit.html#power-supply-options&#34;&gt;Reference Material&lt;/a&gt;
cautions against powering the board simultaneously from the USB port and an external 3V3 source.  However, there&amp;rsquo;s
likely insufficient headroom 3V3 current from the onboard AMS1117 regulator to power any offboard devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution is to add a solid state normally-closed relay driven from the EXT_5V line.  The relay connects the motherboards 3V3 to
the PICO-V4&amp;rsquo;s VDD33 input. That line will only be powered from the USB, so when it&amp;rsquo;s plugged in it will drive the relay open, isolating
the PICO-V4. The relay I&amp;rsquo;m using currently is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=255-6088-1-ND&#34;&gt;Panasonic AQY412SX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-at-your-own-risk&#34;&gt;USE AT YOUR OWN RISK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve not had a board made using this yet, so use it at your own risk.  I am not liable for anything if you use this for any purpose,
etc. etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of this exercise was to learn how to make a custom part in Eagle, but I also plan to use these boards a lot - so having this
part in my library is a good thing.  Since I had seen others seeking something similar, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d open source it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uber Driver Teaches me Data Analytics</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/uber-driver-data/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2018 11:33:02 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;An Uber Driver this past week schooled me that data analytics does not require coding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-random-uber-ride&#34;&gt;A Random Uber Ride&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to run downtown this past week and Uber&amp;rsquo;s time to a ride was 10 minutes faster than Flywheel.  I do try to give the
cabs my business if I can, but it&amp;rsquo;s a supply and demand thing.  If I can wait, fine.  That day I was in a rush.  As usual,
I chat with the driver.  &amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s business?&amp;rdquo; I always ask.  I tell you, if cabbies (and Uber drivers) are busy then folks
are parting with their cash to run around.  If they are quiet, our economy is quiet.  That&amp;rsquo;s my theory anyway.  So this guy
was pretty smart, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about San Francisco and he comments that he&amp;rsquo;ll drop me downtown and loop back to the Marina.
He said &amp;ldquo;this time of day there&amp;rsquo;s no pickups downtown, but the Marina and Cow Hollow will have lots.&amp;rdquo;  He picked me up in
Cow Hollow.  I asked him how he knew that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-he-told-me-schooled-me---big-time&#34;&gt;What He Told Me Schooled Me - Big Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he&amp;rsquo;d been driving Uber for about six months.  At first he struggled, always seeming to be in the wrong place. But then
he started doing screen shots of the app.  A lot.  He said like every few minutes.  The drivers app shows where the callers are.
Graphically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took those screenshots and imported them in time order into the video editoring software he uses (he told me he&amp;rsquo;s an amateur
videographer).  He then played those videos to see where the concentrations of calls were across the city, across the day. He
kept doing this across both weekdays and weekends and observed where the clusters of calls were.  And he started making money,
staying as busy as he wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed.  A data driven Uber driver!  And he didn&amp;rsquo;t write a single damn line of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a data driven world folks.  It&amp;rsquo;s easy for techies like me to automatically assume the software approach.  But even
if you can&amp;rsquo;t code you can do it, if you have the right mindset.  It&amp;rsquo;s about HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lesson worth thinking about as I head into a New Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;holiday-wishes&#34;&gt;Holiday Wishes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays, and Happy New Year everyone.  May 2019 bring us all health and happiness!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;On Becoming an AWS Certified Solutions Architect (Associate)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/aws-logo-300x138.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to attend the AWS re:Invent conference and was &lt;a href=&#34;http://herlein.com/post/avalanche-reinvent/&#34;&gt;extremely blown away&lt;/a&gt; by the avalanche of technology they are providing.  One of the things that I did while there was sit for the AWS Solutions Architect exam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, I&amp;rsquo;m not a certification guy.  In software development there are few certificates that actually
seem impressive.  I&amp;rsquo;m much more interested in your &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein&#34;&gt;github repository&lt;/a&gt;.  For Networking Cisco has worthwhile certs like CCIE, and I do respect the Security CISSP Certification.  But cloud?  I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a fan.  But lately it&amp;rsquo;s been something on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;m the Principal Architect for a group at Cisco CX and we&amp;rsquo;re moving a lot of our footprint to AWS.  I lead a team of Architects and supervise the work of a larger distributed Architecture team.  I also formed an SRE team and am championing transitioning all our development teams to DevOps.  Cloudy DevOps.  It&amp;rsquo;s become clear that having a way to measure cloud skills would be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I figured what the heck?  Why not see if the test is worth it first-hand?  That has the added value of me not asking my team to do something I&amp;rsquo;m not willing to do. And it&amp;rsquo;s also a good way to measure myself against the industry.  How much do I know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solutions-architect-associate---saa&#34;&gt;Solutions Architect (Associate) - SAA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/AWS_Certified_Logo_SAA_294x230_Color.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/&#34;&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate&lt;/a&gt; exam is  is intended for individuals who perform a solutions architect role. This exam validates an examinee&amp;rsquo;s ability to effectively demonstrate knowledge of how to architect and deploy secure and robust applications on AWS technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It validates an examinee&amp;rsquo;s ability to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define a solution using architectural design principles based on customer requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide implementation guidance based on best practices to the organization throughout the life cycle of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sounds exactly like about 50% of what I ask my architects to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation&#34;&gt;Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with AWS for about six years, and attended re:Invent for the first time in 2013.  At the time I was at a startup that used AWS heavily ($1.5M/year).  I got pretty familiar with EC2, VPC, RDS, ELB, S3, and Redshift. We even dabbled in Kinesis. I converted a &amp;ldquo;lift and shift&amp;rdquo; platform to a real cloud-native solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve done some AWS lately, I was rusty and certainly not current since AWS has moved the chains since I was hands-on daily.  So I did prepare a bit.  Most of my job is teaching cloud-native ideas and I&amp;rsquo;ve built a LOT of cloud systems so the concepts were not something I needed to review.  I was really looking for a review of AWS details.  My starting point was to buy a few books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BJGXPXK/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o09_?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect 2018 Practice Questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great book!  Definitely was worth the review and filled in a few blanks.  I highly recommend this book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GL9N75H/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o08_?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate All-in-One Exam Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t waste your time or money.  This book seemed dated and was poorly written, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think it helps at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS_Certified_Solutions_Architect_Associate_Feb_2018_%20Exam_Guide_v1.5.2.pdf&#34;&gt;AWS Exam Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the source, Luke.  Read this. It sets the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-preparation&#34;&gt;Practical Preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You really need to have had practical experiece if you want to do well on this test.  I know there are folks who can just study for the test and pass it.  But many of the questions are difficult to really understand what they are REALLY asking.  If you have at least the recommended year of experience you will understand most of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can never be prepared enough.  I also played around on my AWS account, did some terraform, reviewed my Route53 DNS configurations for my personal networks, and read up on blogs (AWS and otherwise).  Spinning up and down a few servers both from the command line and from the console just brought a lot back.  Writing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/vpc-tf&#34;&gt;terraform script that properly set up a VPC&lt;/a&gt; was a good idea, since it forced me to review those details too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;practice-tests&#34;&gt;Practice Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the &lt;a href=&#34;https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-sa-assoc/AWS_Certified_Solutions%20Architect_Associate_Feb_2018_Sample%20Questions_v1.0.pdf&#34;&gt;free practice test that AWS offers&lt;/a&gt; and got a 90%.  I took the paid practice test and passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some folks that swear by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.udemy.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate-amazon-practice-exams&#34;&gt;Udemy Practice Tests&lt;/a&gt; but I did not use those.  I would have, had I known about them then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I signed up and took the test.  I had about a week&amp;rsquo;s prep.  Maybe 8 hours of total review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and&#34;&gt;And?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/cert.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.certmetrics.com/amazon/public/badge.aspx?i=1&amp;t=c&amp;d=2018-11-27&amp;ci=AWS00688634&#34;&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; with an 87.5% grade.  Normally I&amp;rsquo;d be aiming for an ace, but in this case I was evaluating the process as much as wanting to accomplish a certification.  And I wanted to take the test at the conference so studying longer just was not an option.  It really was a measure of what was in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-is-it-worth-it&#34;&gt;So Is it Worth It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This certification is worth it.  Passing this test definitely demonstrates that you have a certain level of understanding, with an AWS-centric twist.  The questions are basically &amp;ldquo;what approach would you use to solve this customer ask?&amp;rdquo; and the answers are AWS specific of course.  But you cannot get them right unless you really understand the WHY that underlies it.  WHY does a VPC protect you?  HOW does an ALB help you scale?  That kind of thing.  If you just read the books without having the real experience you may well fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely plan on preparing and sitting for the Professional Exam.  From the looks of the practice test, it&amp;rsquo;s MUCH harder, as you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For passing the test at re:Invent I even got some cool swag.  The coolest was a T-Shirt with binary on it.  According the web some of the octets glow in the dark - I&amp;rsquo;ve not been in a dark enough place to test it yet but luckily the Internet has pictures of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/binary-shirt.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an exercise for the reader to figure out what it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting for?  Go get certified already!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Avalanche! re:Invent 2018</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/avalanche-reinvent/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Dec 2018 10:50:01 -0800</pubDate>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Thoughts on AWS re:Invent 2018&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;avalanche-reinvent-2018&#34;&gt;Avalanche! re:Invent 2018&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I last attended AWS&amp;rsquo;s re:Invent five years ago, in 2013.  Back then it was a big deal.  It filled a huge
venue, had over 200 sessions, and plentiful vendors.  I had some excellent chats with AWS
staff about how spot instances and their market really worked.  It was, and still is, one of the best tech
conferences I have ever been to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;five-years&#34;&gt;Five Years&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended this year&amp;rsquo;s re:Invent.  What a difference 5 years makes! Seven huge venues, all along the strip.  Bus service between them all.  Thousands of sessions. Yes, thousands.  I&amp;rsquo;d say countless but somewhere there is a database of them all that someone could do a count on.  Mere humans reading the catalog?  No.  Too many.  If you didn&amp;rsquo;t pre-register for most
sessions then you had to settle for overflow seating.  Which worked, maybe better than being there.  You sat in an
area with rows of chairs.  Each area had color coded headphones keyed to a certain session.  You just sat
and listened.  And met folks that also attended after, and chatted.  The regular sessions just had a human you can see.  I highly recommend viewing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/user/AmazonWebServices&#34;&gt;recordings&lt;/a&gt;.
There was some excellent material covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-the-overwhelming-part-was&#34;&gt;But the Overwhelming Part Was&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product announcements.  By my count AWS made 81 (yes, &lt;strong&gt;EIGHTY-ONE&lt;/strong&gt;) &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/new/reinvent/&#34;&gt;major new or improved product announcements&lt;/a&gt;.  That&amp;rsquo;s basically 16 announcements PER DAY across a five day conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that for a minute.  How many products did your company launch or dramatically improve this year?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thought so.  I work for a major company.  Fortune 50.  We&amp;rsquo;re split into a lot of business units, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep
track, but if we did 20 significant launches this year I&amp;rsquo;d be pretty surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sheer number of announcements just made me dizzy.  The energy in room was crackling.  I don&amp;rsquo;t think I was the only one feeling like a kid on Christmas morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meaning-what-exactly&#34;&gt;Meaning What Exactly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So AWS is big. They released a lot.  So what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AWS is exploding with new innovation, solidifying foundations, and closing off
markets where competition could find some traction.  I&amp;rsquo;ll go into details later.  But the sheer volume is staggering.
Earlier this year it was reported that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/03/aws-is-the-fifth-biggest-business-software-company-in-the-world.html&#34;&gt;AWS is the fifth largest software company in the world&lt;/a&gt;.  So you expect a lot, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is the biggest, of course, and certainly doing great with Azure.  IBM is next, and just bought Red Hat - which
certainly makes sense in the light of this comparison. Oracle is after that - but we know where most of their
revenue comes from.  Aside:  two interesting things about Oracle.  One is that AWS officially announced that on
November 5th they turned off the last Oracle instance at Amazon.  Boom.  The other is how hard Oracle is trying
to get into the cloud game.  They are even hiring a team to build out a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/sr-director-software-development-manager-bare-metal-cloud-team-oracle-JV_IC1139994_KO0,62_KE63,69.htm?jl=3053536712&#34;&gt;bare metal cloud&lt;/a&gt; which should amuse those of you who know me.  I led a crack team that built a working bare metal cloud over two
years ago at Cisco.  Ask me over a beer sometime what happened.  Anyway, next is SAP who are also definitely getting
into the cloud game based on hiring patterns.  And then the upstart AWS.  Not Amazon, just the AWS part of Amazon.  And they are reinvesting heavily back into their own business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what matters, in my opinion, is that 100% of AWS is cloud-native.  By definition.  And mutually reinforcing.  The
entire thing is all a set of interlocking PaaS components ready for companies to build on top of.  They eat their own dog food and leverage their own cloud to build more PaaS components which leads to faster deployment which leads to more components and features&amp;hellip; and suddenly you have an avalanche accelerating down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about that.  And think about what it will look like in five more years.  Avalanche.  Sheer Technology Avalanche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/avalanche.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;closing-off-markets&#34;&gt;Closing Off Markets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, Microsoft is the real deal.  They have embraced Linux, leveraged their massive Enterprise footprint and
penetration, and built out a credible cloud.  Azure is a public cloud but can be deployed on-premise as a local cloud.
And since they are solid with the Fortune 500 already, it&amp;rsquo;s not that hard to argue &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t move to AWS, just run
Azure on premise and burst into our cloud.&amp;rdquo;  Smart.  And it&amp;rsquo;s been working.  Look at their cloud revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then AWS announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/announcing-aws-outposts/&#34;&gt;Outposts&lt;/a&gt;.  This is basically the same hardware and software that AWS deploys, only you deploy it in your own data center.  Data ownership concerns?  Not.  Oh, and AWS will install and operate it too.  This basically gives it the same &amp;ldquo;shift CapEx to OpEx&amp;rdquo; benefit as cloud only it&amp;rsquo;s
right on your own premise.  I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to understand the pricing model.  This is the game change of all game
changes if AWS can do this right.  Now there&amp;rsquo;s at least something to sell against Azure on-prem.  And if it
includes all the new whizbang stuff then Microsoft will have a VERY hard time keeping up.  How many cloud-native PaaS product announcements did they do this year?  Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not have to even be all that successful financially to be vastly successful.  This is the Azure antidote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;solidifying-foundations&#34;&gt;Solidifying Foundations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the releases were &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; upgrades to existing services.  But do any of the other cloud providers even have
81 services to start with?  Set that aside.  These were significant improvements to major services.  What struck me was the concrete improvements to compute, database, storage and machine learning  offerings in particular.  Compute saw new &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-amazon-ec2-a1-instances/&#34;&gt;ARM-based A1 instances&lt;/a&gt; that are dirt cheap, integration of &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/alb-can-now-invoke-lambda-functions-to-serve-https-requests/&#34;&gt;ALB directly into Lambda&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;m still reeling about, and a new massive &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/p3/#Amazon_EC2_P3dn.24xlarge_Instances&#34;&gt;P3dn instance type&lt;/a&gt; that honestly is a scary level of compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Databases saw support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/announcing-amazon-dynamodb-support-for-transactions/&#34;&gt;transactions in Dynamo DB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/announcing-amazon-aurora-global-database/&#34;&gt;multi-region Aurora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/announcing-amazon-dynamodb-on-demand/&#34;&gt;DynamoDB on demand&lt;/a&gt;.  These take already incredibly compelling database offers to outer space levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage offers added &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/coming-soon-amazon-efs-infrequent-access-storage-class/&#34;&gt;EFS Infrequent Access&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/s3-glacier-deep-archive/&#34;&gt;S3 Glacier Deep Archive&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/s3-glacier-api-simplification/&#34;&gt;Four new S3 features&lt;/a&gt;.  These all offer huge cost savings that will make any CFO dance (yes, some of them will dance if costs drop low
enough).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their already ground-breaking Machine Learning offerings got even better.  I&amp;rsquo;m planning on a lot of time in the coming
quarter to really dive into these.  Right off the top I can say that &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/introducing-amazon-sagemaker-groundtruth/&#34;&gt;SageMaker Ground Truth&lt;/a&gt; will change the game, forever.  When we look back on
2018 we will think that re:Invent was the week that ML became really available for the masses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enough-with-the-business-stuff---new-innovation&#34;&gt;Enough with the Business Stuff - New Innovation!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot even begin to cover all the new stuff they released.  I&amp;rsquo;ve not even really looked at all the IoT
stuff yet, but I know I&amp;rsquo;m going to go nuts over the new FreeRTOS things.  More on that later and how it plays into my &lt;a href=&#34;http://herlein.com/post/i2c-for-robot/&#34;&gt;RBOT&lt;/a&gt; project.  For now, what really got my attention are three things:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/announcing-aws-ground-station-preview&#34;&gt;GroundStation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/11/announcing-aws-robomaker-a-new-cloud-robotics-service&#34;&gt;RoboMaker&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/&#34;&gt;DeepRacer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;groundstation&#34;&gt;GroundStation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/ground-station/&#34;&gt;description page&lt;/a&gt;.  I&amp;rsquo;ve not actually tried to do anything with it yet.  But dang, this sure looks like the other side of the puzzle to do some space science.  I coach high school robotics (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SHC-Robotics-Team-8255&#34;&gt;SHCP Vex Team 8255&lt;/a&gt;) and one of the &amp;ldquo;after-season&amp;rdquo; projects we are looking at doing is to build a CubeSat for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-cubesat-launch-initiative&#34;&gt;NASA&amp;rsquo;s CubeSat Launch Initiative&lt;/a&gt;.  Suddenly this looks really, really possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kinds of innovation are right around the corner with this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;robomaker&#34;&gt;RoboMaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is sort of like what AWS did with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/freertos/&#34;&gt;FreeRTOS&lt;/a&gt; only with &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Concepts&#34;&gt;Robot Operating System - ROS&lt;/a&gt; - only with a fully functional simulation environment.  Yes, you can construct a robot in a simulation, upload your code to it, and run simulatons on how it behaves.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus!  I cannot wait for the time off these holidays to actually start to play with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;deepracer&#34;&gt;DeepRacer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/&#34;&gt;robotic self-driving car at 1/18 scale&lt;/a&gt;.  Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s like a toy remote control car, only it&amp;rsquo;s autonomous.  And you can use the AWS ML tools to do &amp;ldquo;reinforcement learning&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;teach&amp;rdquo; it to drive itself.  Folks, this is taking the sci-fi startup technology into your living room.  The cars don&amp;rsquo;t ship until March 6 (what a birthday present for me!).  You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JMHRKQG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;pre-order&lt;/a&gt; now for only $249 before they go up to $399.  No idea how yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m betting the hacking opportunities with this thing will be incredible.  By the way, I bought my car within minutes of Werner Vogels announcing it.  I bought one for my high school robotics team too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;leaving-las-vegas&#34;&gt;Leaving Las Vegas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/leaving-las-vegas.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, leaving re:Invent&amp;hellip; was bittersweet.  It&amp;rsquo;s not my favorite place and I&amp;rsquo;ve done way more than my share of tradeshowsthere (attending and working).  CES, NAB, and InfoComm can still make me tired just thinking about them.  But I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the excitement to end. On the other hand, getting home meant some time to play with all this stuff.  Any
self-respecting geek would be chomping at the bit to get their hands on all this technology.  I cannot imagine
anyone not wanting to just dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands down this year&amp;rsquo;s re:Invent is now the best tech conference I have ever been to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Engineering Leadership 321</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/eng-leadership-321/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2018 21:30:29 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/eng-leadership-321/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve come to firmly believe that Engineering Leadership has a 3-2-1 principle to create Engineer happiness,
which is a key prerequisite for high performance Engineering teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;engineer-happiness-leads-to-high-performance-teams&#34;&gt;Engineer Happiness Leads to High Performance Teams&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Engineers are like most people:  they want to be happy at work.  Unlike some people though Engineers get a
significant amount of overall happiness FROM work, so it can be a dis-proportionally big factor in their overall
happiness in life.  It&amp;rsquo;s not just because Engineering can mean long hours.  Many Engineers are also makers,
folks compelled to make.  Many really want to do a great job, and crave the recognition of other smart Engineers
that their work is good and valuable.  I believe this is a key part of what drives Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have observed that there&amp;rsquo;s a set of things that need to be in place for an Engineer to be
happy in his or her job.  These have nothing to do with which technology or platform is being used.  It has to do
with the overall environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Engineers are productive Engineers.  Happy Engineers invent amazing new things.  Happy Engineers
deliver products and solve problems.  Happy Engineers are the key to having a high performance Engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;three-factors-of-motivation&#34;&gt;Three Factors of Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Engineers are pretty simple when it comes to what motivates them.  I think it boils down to three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engineers want to BUILD things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things that help people somehow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things that actually get used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is trickier than you think.  Lots of projects and companies are actually not all that helpful - they are just
an excuse to play with a technology.  If you want to really tap into the core of an Engineer you cannot do better
than to have something that really makes a difference for other folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, it has to &amp;ldquo;ship.&amp;rdquo;  Making something that never sees the &amp;ldquo;market&amp;rdquo; (however you define that) is a sure
way to undermine the motivation of an Engineer.  It saps the energy almost as if it were a thousand leeches.  There&amp;rsquo;s
nothing quite like the rush for an Engineer who can point out what they built to other people and say &amp;ldquo;see that?
I helped build that.&amp;rdquo;  It&amp;rsquo;s just so powerful.  Once you taste that as an Engineer you want more.  What you build
needs to be used to really fuel that core motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience teams need at least two of these to be a functional team.  Less than that and the team
motivation hits the basement and you&amp;rsquo;ll find yourself in a deep hole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;team-environment&#34;&gt;Team Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Engineers like to work alone, especially on tasks like design and coding.  But I&amp;rsquo;ve only really known a few
that were really loners.  Most Engineers want a team &amp;ldquo;around&amp;rdquo; them, even if it&amp;rsquo;s virtual.  Teams that are
scattered remotely can definitely work just as well (or better) than teams that are co-located - if the
communication is there, and if the right team environment exists.  In my experience the two factors most
important to this are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with smart people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In an environment that prioritizes learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering teams are complex, living things.  There&amp;rsquo;s way more to team dynamics than two points, but I&amp;rsquo;ve
found that if these are missing you simply cannot make a high performance Engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;smart-people&#34;&gt;Smart People&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good Engineers want to work with other smart Engineers.  It&amp;rsquo;s a key attractor for getting great folks to
join your team.  If you have smart Engineers and they are not part of your interview process you are
missing the boat!  Engineers want peers who they can count on, and that they can learn from.  They want
folks that they can bounce ideas off.  They want folks that can bring new ideas.  They want folks that are
not just additive to the team but multiplicative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-environment&#34;&gt;Learning Environment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to perhaps the more important of the two:  a genuine learning environment.  Pointy heads say
that all the time so why am I too?  Show me a good Engineer and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you someone who constantly
learns.  New languages, new open source projects, new technologies.  Take away learning from a good
Engineer is like taking away their oxygen.  It&amp;rsquo;s needed for them to live.  Good Engineers will do learning
whether it&amp;rsquo;s at work or not.  Good Engineers seem to always be making things on the side, learning and
testing and making.  But if those Engineers can do it at work it&amp;rsquo;s a force magnifier.  Google does
&amp;ldquo;20% time&amp;rdquo; specifically to embrace this.  You can do that but there&amp;rsquo;s other ways too.  Let them buy books!
They are so cheap and it&amp;rsquo;s surprising how some companies deny those expenses.  Send folks to conferences!
That checks several of the boxes on this list.  Organize brown bag lunch meetings and bring in speakers.
Actively encourage experiments with new technology.  You&amp;rsquo;ll find that it&amp;rsquo;s like making a feast: all your
Engineers will eat and everyone will be happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-final-one-thing&#34;&gt;The Final One Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is one thing that over time matters more than anything else.  It&amp;rsquo;s not something that has
immediate effect but over time it becomes either a core foundation or a corrosive agent that can disolve the
entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust in the team.  Trust in the company.  Trust in the team leader/manager.  Especially trust in the manager.
To most Engineers the company is nebulous - it&amp;rsquo;s suits and pointy heads and bean counters and sales-folk.
The team manager &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the face of the company.  If that person is not trusted then the value of all the
stuff above may not matter.  But trust is a fickle thing.  In my experience Engineers are often initially
skeptical but cautiously optimisitc.  That optimism can be whittled away until the skepticism turns into
hostility.  When that happens all hope is lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, when Engineers trust that their management has their back then all things are possible. A key
part of building that trust is ensuring that folks know that it&amp;rsquo;s OK to make mistakes.  You learn from
mistakes. Mistakes can guide you towards better solutions.  If there&amp;rsquo;s trust that the process for
handling mistakes is fair and impartial then progress happens.  If that process is arbitrary, or biased,
or cherry-picked, then trust erodes.  Those processes are embodied in the team manager (whether it&amp;rsquo;s
their process or not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads me to the observation that the MOST IMPORTANT single factor of Engineering leadership is
making sure that the team (line) managers are doing a good job, that you picked the right ones, that you
are mentoring them and paying attention.  Doing this is visible.  The teams will see that their more
senior leaders care about how the team managers are doing - and more trust is built.  Conversely, in my
experience, once a good Engineer decides that he or she does not trust their boss it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter
of time before they&amp;rsquo;ll find a new boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy really, as easy as 3-2-1.  I wish.  Getting all this right to build a high performance
Engineering team is far from easy.  It takes constant effort, deep caring and a lot of work.  But
hard work alone cannot be successful.  Just like you cannot code high performance software by just
working a lot of hours - you need to understand and correctly use the right algorithms and
technolgies.  Similarly, building a team requires that you understand what makes teams tick. I don&amp;rsquo;t
pretend to completely understand these dynamics but I have learned these lessons over the years.  I
hope they are of some value to you all.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I2c Tools for Project RBOT</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/i2c-for-robot/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Sep 2018 08:44:43 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blog.herlein.com/post/i2c-for-robot/</guid>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I2C Tools I am Using for the RBOT Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-am-working-on&#34;&gt;What I am Working On&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am building out a robotics system that I&amp;rsquo;ve named RBOT.  It&amp;rsquo;s eventually going to be a product, but first
I have to get it&amp;rsquo;s core built out.  And that&amp;rsquo;s all based on &lt;a href=&#34;http://i2c.info/&#34;&gt;I2C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;oscilloscope&#34;&gt;Oscilloscope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to write code for electronics that deals in bits changing, especially with bits changing
relative to other bits changing then you definitely need a scope.  You can spend a LOT of money on
an amazing scope but you can get a really decent scope for under $400.  I like the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Rigol-DS1054Z-Digital-Oscilloscopes-Bandwidth/dp/B012938E76&#34;&gt;Rigol DS1054Z&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Search the web a bit and there&amp;rsquo;s some upgrades you can hack yourself, if you want to double it&amp;rsquo;s bandwidth
from 50MHz to 100MHz.  I rarely need more than 2 channels, but when you need it you really need it.  I commonly
use two channels.  Looking at an I2C waveform on the scope looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Rigol I2C Waveform&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/rigol-i2c.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sniffer&#34;&gt;Sniffer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key tool is an I2C sniffer to passively read the digits from the wire.  Luckily I had one in a drawer
that was going to get tossed from a company I worked at years ago.  I hoard that kind of thing so as I got
serious about I2C I pulled it out.  Lucky for me after a firmware update it still works!  Some tools are just
timeless I guess.  It&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.totalphase.com/products/beagle-i2cspi/&#34;&gt;Total Phase Beagle&lt;/a&gt; and it uses
their &amp;ldquo;Data Center&amp;rdquo; software.  It basically does for I2C what wireshark does for networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Beagle Capture Screenshot&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/i2c-sniffer.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-bench&#34;&gt;My Bench&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly you need to wire things up.  You can use a breadboard but I&amp;rsquo;ve found that the capacitance of the
breadboard could affect things, so I made a rig that has male pins wired in common busses for the clock (SCK)
and data (SDA) busses, along with rails for ground and 3V3 - and 4.7kOhm resistors as pull ups on both
the lines.  I added a 2x5 pin male header wired to match the Beagle and it makes for an extremely easy
way to plug it all together and still monitor what&amp;rsquo;s going on.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;My I2C Bench&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/bench.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;simavr&#34;&gt;SimAvr&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since one of the parts I am working with is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet.pdf&#34;&gt;ATTiny85&lt;/a&gt; that I plan to use an I2C client,
I&amp;rsquo;m really in the dark about what the code on that little AVR processor is doing.  There&amp;rsquo;s no JTAG and only
a few spare GPIO pins to blink an LED or something to let me know what&amp;rsquo;s up.  Luckily I just found a
nifty looking tool:  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/buserror/simavr&#34;&gt;SimAVR&lt;/a&gt;.  This tool claims to let me run
code compiled for the AVR inside it and simulate being in a real chip.  I just installed it (and sent a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/buserror/simavr/pull/305&#34;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; and will be diving into how to use it next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals&#34;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aim is not only to be able to hang I2C sensors off the bus, but to create my own sensors and actuators
using the ATTiny chips.  The AVR will sit on the I2C bus and &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s other 4 lines can generate
PWM, read voltages, drive relays, whatever.  These parts are under $2 in qty 1 so they are very affordable.
When I&amp;rsquo;m done I&amp;rsquo;ll have a whole robotics system that works on I2C, and a set of Golang code to drive all of
it over MQTT.  I already have a version of this that natively works on the Raspberry Pi called
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/pi-blaster-mqtt&#34;&gt;pi-blaster-mqtt&lt;/a&gt; but I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be bound to the
RPi so tightly.  I have a manual control proof of concept using an XBox Controller too.  See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gherlein/goxb_mqtt&#34;&gt;goxb_mqtt&lt;/a&gt;.  Eventually, MQTT will be the network bus and I2C
will be the robot bus.  Lots of work between here and there to make that real!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;Google Analytics Alternative&#34; href=&#34;https://clicky.com/101366448&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/media/links/badge.gif&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;//static.getclicky.com/101366448.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Clicky&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; src=&#34;//in.getclicky.com/101366448ns.gif&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nxp.com/products/analog/interfaces/ic-bus/ic-general-purpose-i-o/low-voltage-translating-16-bit-ic-bus-smbus-i-o-expander:PCAL6416A&#34;&gt;NXP PCAL6416A&lt;/a&gt; is a 16-bit GPIO port expander with an I2C interface.  One thing I like about it a lot is that it supports level shifting, making it easy to use 5V GPIO with a low voltage controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why&#34;&gt;Why?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my projects is a water-based robot.  I want to minimize the number of &amp;ldquo;hull penetrations&amp;rdquo; for sensors - especially for GPIO.  I am definitely thinking of multiple LED lights at a minimum and I don&amp;rsquo;t want one penetration for each.  I can put a single PCAL6416A in a potted box outside my pressure hull and get 16 GPIO for using only a few wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other things I really want to do is see if I can run multiple &lt;a href=&#34;https://components101.com/ultrasonic-sensor-working-pinout-datasheet&#34;&gt;HC-SR04 ultrasonic transducers&lt;/a&gt; on one of these things.  The sensor is triggered by a 5V GPIO and then it generates a pulse on the echo pin.  The duration of the pulse is the distance sensed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pack of 5 of these sensors are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Gowoops-Ultrasonic-Distance-Measuring-Transducer/dp/B00UJA1TAQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531622626&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=HC-SR04&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;$10 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with Prime shipping included.  A pentagon-shaped cluster of these sitting on the 16 GPIO pins of the PCAL6416A would make a handy I2C-based 360 degree proximit sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hardware&#34;&gt;Hardware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chips are 24 pin TSSOP - yep, surface mount.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.digikey.com&#34;&gt;DigiKey&lt;/a&gt; had them in stock (their site is down for maintenance at the moment so I don&amp;rsquo;t have a direct link).  To make them easy to work with on a breadboard I bought some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A0VH402/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&#34;&gt;breakout boards&lt;/a&gt;.  They all arrived today so it was off to the races.  Here&amp;rsquo;s what the chip looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;PCAL6416A&#34; src=&#34;https://blog.herlein.com/images/PCAL6416A.JPG&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;soldering&#34;&gt;Soldering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first surface mount soldering effort.  I could not have done it without the highpower stereo magnifier I bought at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.electronicsfleamarket.com/&#34;&gt;Sunnyvale Electronics Flea Market&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago.  I wet the pads and then cleaned them with solder wick, then used tweezers to position the part and hold it in place and then applied heat to each pad.  It was slow going but it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;success&#34;&gt;Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wired up a BeagleBone Black to the breakout board and sure enough, the part is there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;debian@beaglebone:~/src$ i2cdetect -y -r 2
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to start playing with the registers to understand this part.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World</title>
      <link>https://blog.herlein.com/post/hello-world/</link>

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been procrastinating setting up a real blog for&amp;hellip; well, years.  Now it&amp;rsquo;s here.  Read on for the why and the how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-now&#34;&gt;Why Now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why now?  Dunno.  It seems like it&amp;rsquo;s the right time to start contributing my thoughts again. I could just post things on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; like I did about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/golang-enabling-unikernels-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;Unikernels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/technology-rolls-better-roll-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;Tech Changes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-do-devops-greg-herlein/&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt;.  I could say some crap here about wanting to &amp;ldquo;control the eyeballs&amp;rdquo; or some such thing.  I don&amp;rsquo;t really care about that since this is not something I&amp;rsquo;m trying to monetize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do have loose plans to build and sell a hardware product this coming year and I want to document my progress.  And my open source coding work needs a place to write about.  And LinkedIn just does not seen like the right place for those kinds of posts.  So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-tools&#34;&gt;What tools?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t fancy paying for an AWS EC2 instance just to host a blob, though I have done that in the past.   I pretty much live in GitHub these days anyway and they offer &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; which seems to be easy to use.  Clearly this will be a static page web site.  They suggest Jekyl, but that&amp;rsquo;s a ruby thing.  Do I really want to deal with gems and ruby versions and that whole ecosystem?  Nah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead I went with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s written in GoLang (go) which is my newest plaything (and likely tooling for much of what I do that&amp;rsquo;s not in C).  It was &lt;a href=&#34;https://opensource.com/article/18/3/start-blog-30-minutes-hugo&#34;&gt;easy to install&lt;/a&gt; and there&amp;rsquo;s excellent documentation on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/&#34;&gt;how to make it happy on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit I spent a lot of time dorking around with different themes.  I have the artistic ability of a rock (ok, maybe not that bad) and it&amp;rsquo;s been ten years since I joyfully left any front-end work behind, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be making my own theme soon.  I wanted simple and clean, with social media links and a layout that didn&amp;rsquo;t look stupid to me.  After all, I&amp;rsquo;ll probably be the one to read this most often (ha ha).  I ended up picking &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn&#34;&gt;Blackburn&lt;/a&gt;.  It&amp;rsquo;s meeting my needs and hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll still like it in a month.  I do tend to get caught up in silly things like wanting it to look a certain way and then wasting tons of hours tweaking things just to go back to simple later.  It&amp;rsquo;s a flaw of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, that&amp;rsquo;s the tool chain.  I just write posts in markdown and use Hugo to  generate a static site that I publish into a GitHub repo.  GitHub Pages takes care of the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;comments&#34;&gt;Comments?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?  Drop me a note somehow.   Links are to the left.  I don&amp;rsquo;t want to put a direct email link but you can reach me at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;gherlein &amp;lt;at&amp;gt; herlein.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m considering enabling Disqus for comments, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know that I really want to deal with that yet.  First things first:  Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
