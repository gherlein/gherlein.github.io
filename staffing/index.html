  <h1 id="my-software-team-philosophy">My Software Team Philosophy</h1>
<p>In my experience, smaller teams of higher-skilled Engineers outperform larger teams of less-skilled Engineers.  I don&rsquo;t believe in armies of offshore coders.</p>
<p>Building software is not physical labor, and it’s not something that can be easily broken into parallel parts for development.  That approach is often taken, especially when offshoring, but it requires substantial up-front planning and then even more work to test that all the parts fit together at the end.  Unless you are doing waterfall development and you have solid skills in upfront planning this will generally take a lot longer than you think and the results will be a mish-mash of parts that hopefully work together.</p>
<p>I believe that fewer, better skilled Engineers will build a better product, faster.  This leads to the obvious conclusion that one must become good at identifying, recruiting and retaining higher quality Engineers.</p>
<p>I did an interview on the <a href="https://blog.herlein.com/post/synergy-podcast/">Software Synergy Podcast</a> in March of 2024 where I talk about some of this.</p>
<p>But what attributes are you really going for?</p>
<h1 id="desired-attributes-of-software-staff">Desired Attributes of Software Staff</h1>
<p>No single candidate will have all or even most of these attributes.  This is a list of attributes that tend to profile candidates that I have observed to have been successful in building the kind of software that I am drawn to build.</p>
<p>I have the most experience building SaaS software that also has a hardware side (either embedded or mobile).  I think this applies to an increasing amount of the kinds of systems we all use every day, especially as IoT becomes normal.  These are distributed systems of varying scales that span multiple technology areas.</p>
<p>This list is of course not prescriptive and does not apply in all cases.  But in my experience it&rsquo;s directionally accurate.</p>
<h2 id="ideal-leadership-structure-and-scope">Ideal Leadership Structure and Scope</h2>
<p>Smaller teams (3-5) can be led by an Engineering Lead but larger teams (5-8) usually need an Engineering Manager.  Several teams form a group.  A smaller group can have a Senior Manager, usually if there is some common thread across the teams (product, tech stack, geography, etc.).  A group that is composed of several different teams spanning products, technologies, and/or geographies is led by a Director.  Team leaders would report to that Director.  This pattern scales out from there.  Up to 5-8 Directors report to a VP, etc.</p>
<p>Typical attributes of Engineering Leaders include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong bias for action – see problem, fix problem</li>
<li>Strong sense of “ownership” – it’s not ever “someone else’s problem”</li>
<li>Extremely technical background – not “just people a leader”</li>
<li>Has strong opinions loosely held – knows what “right” looks like</li>
<li>Demands the best of themselves and those around them</li>
<li>Has the courage of their convictions – stands up for what they believe</li>
<li>And, has the ability to commit to a course of action once a decision in made</li>
</ul>
<p>These mirror some of the famous <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles">Amazon Leadership Principles</a>.  Bonus points for understanding the different skills required for each level of leadership (see the fantastic book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Pipeline-Developing-Leaders-Digital-dp-1394160976/dp/1394160976/ref=dp_ob_title_bk">“Leadership Pipeline.”</a>).</p>
<p>I also am a strong believer in what Netflix calls a <a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture">&ldquo;Dream Team&rdquo;</a>.  They say it best:  &ldquo;Imagine working alongside stunning colleagues who are great at what they do, and even better at working together.&rdquo;  And great Engineering teams ARE more like sports teams.  Hiring is about team composition and leadership.</p>
<h2 id="attributes-i-look-for-in-engineers">Attributes I Look for in Engineers</h2>
<p>Typical attributes of Engineers I seek for my teams include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ideal candidate has startup experience, or time on a team operating like a startup</li>
<li>Self-starter, high “bias for action”</li>
<li>Constant lifelong learner and problem solver</li>
<li>Builds things – does not have to be tech, but actually <em>creates</em> things</li>
<li>The kind of person who says &ldquo;how can I help&rdquo; instead of “that’s not my job”</li>
<li>The kind of person who says &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll figure it out&rdquo; instead of “I don’t know how to do that”</li>
<li>Actively curious, especially about how things work</li>
<li>Comfortable multi-tasking when needed</li>
<li>Multi-disciplinary – knows many technologies, not afraid to learn more</li>
<li>Goal-oriented, biased towards action, gets things done</li>
<li>Does not let the perfect get in the way of good enough to ship</li>
<li>Plays with technology for fun, is an inventor/creator</li>
