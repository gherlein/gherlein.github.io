  <p>Grace Hopper built the first compiler in 1952. They said &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t make them understand English-like instructions.&rdquo; She had a <em>running compiler</em> and nobody would touch it.  Sound familiar? Grace had some thoughts about this kind of thinking. She had a <em>lot</em> of thoughts, actually.</p>
<center>

<br><small>Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper -- mathematician, Navy officer, and the person who proved everyone wrong about compilers.</small>
</center>
<h2 id="a-quick-history-lesson">A Quick History Lesson</h2>
<p>In 1952, Grace Hopper created the A-0 System &ndash; the first compiler. The idea was straightforward: let humans write instructions in something closer to English, and let the machine translate that into the binary it actually executes. Logical, right?</p>
<p>The reaction from the computing establishment was&hellip; not enthusiasm.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic.&rdquo; &ndash; Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, as quoted in <em>Grace Hopper: Navy Admiral and Computer Pioneer</em> by Charlene W. Billings (1989), p. 74</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let that sink in. She had <em>working software</em> that proved the concept, and the response was &ldquo;nah, that&rsquo;s not how we do things.&rdquo; The objection wasn&rsquo;t technical. It was psychological. People had mastered assembly language and machine code. That was &ldquo;real programming.&rdquo; A compiler was cheating. It was a crutch. It would produce inferior output. The machine would never be as good as a human at writing machine code.</p>
<p>Every single one of those objections turned out to be wrong. Compilers won. COBOL happened. Fortran happened. Eventually C, Java, Python, Go &ndash; every language you&rsquo;ve ever used exists because Grace Hopper was right and the naysayers were wrong.</p>
<p>The compiler didn&rsquo;t replace programmers. It made them wildly more productive. It freed them to think about <em>problems</em> instead of opcodes.</p>
<h2 id="the-abstraction-ladder">The Abstraction Ladder</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the thing that keeps rattling around in my head. Look at the history of programming as a series of abstraction layers:</p>
<p><strong>Machine code</strong> &ndash;&gt; <strong>Assembly</strong> &ndash;&gt; <strong>High-level languages</strong> &ndash;&gt; <strong>???</strong></p>
<p>Every single step up that ladder was resisted by the people who had mastered the layer below. Assembly programmers thought compilers were toys. C programmers thought garbage-collected languages were for amateurs. Desktop developers thought the web was a fad.</p>
<p>And now? That next rung on the ladder is <strong>natural language</strong>. LLMs and coding agents are, functionally, a new kind of compiler. The input is human intent expressed in English. The output is working code. The abstraction is the same pattern we&rsquo;ve seen for 70 years, just one more step up.</p>
<p>The objections today are <em>identical</em> to the objections in 1952:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1952: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not real programming.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2025: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not real programming.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1952: &ldquo;You need to understand the machine.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2025: &ldquo;You need to understand the code.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1952: &ldquo;Compiler output is inefficient garbage.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2025: &ldquo;AI-generated code is buggy garbage.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Same song, different decade.</p>

<br><small>The abstraction ladder. Every rung was resisted. Every rung won.</small>

<h2 id="you-dont-run-against-logic">You Don&rsquo;t Run Against Logic</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Developing a compiler was a logical move; but in matters like this, you don&rsquo;t run against logic &ndash; you run against people who can&rsquo;t change their minds.&rdquo; &ndash; Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, The OCLC Newsletter, No. 167 (March/April 1987)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the quote that hits hardest for me. The resistance to AI-assisted coding is not a technical argument. Not really. It&rsquo;s an <em>identity</em> argument. People who have spent years &ndash; decades &ndash; mastering the craft of writing code by hand feel threatened by a tool that changes what &ldquo;mastery&rdquo; looks like.</p>
<p>I get it. I really do. I&rsquo;ve been writing code since I was a kid on a TRS-80 with 4K of RAM. I&rsquo;ve invested a LOT of my life in learning how to write good software. But here&rsquo;s the distinction that matters:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I am a person who writes code&rdquo;</strong> is not the same as <strong>&ldquo;I am a person who builds software.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Compilers didn&rsquo;t eliminate the need to think. They eliminated the need to think about the <em>wrong things.</em> Nobody mourns the loss of hand-coding branch offsets in hex. LLM coding agents are doing the same thing one layer up. They don&rsquo;t eliminate the need to think. They eliminate the need to type boilerplate, remember API signatures, and manually implement patterns you&rsquo;ve written a hundred times before.</p>
<p>The skill shifts from <em>writing</em> code to <em>directing, reviewing, and architecting</em> code. That&rsquo;s not a downgrade. If anything, it&rsquo;s harder. You need to understand systems at a deeper level to prompt effectively, review critically, and catch the subtle bugs. The people who think AI coding is &ldquo;easy mode&rdquo; haven&rsquo;t done it seriously.</p>
<h2 id="weve-always-done-it-this-way">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve Always Done It This Way&rdquo;</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve always done it this way.&rsquo; I try to fight that. That&rsquo;s why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise.&rdquo; &ndash; Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, The OCLC Newsletter, No. 167 (March/April 1987)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love this woman. Seriously.</p>
<center>
<img src="https://blog.herlein.com/images/always-done-it-this-way-not.jpg" width="50%" alt="But we've always done it this way -- NOT!">
</center>
<p>The loudest critics of AI coding tools share one common trait: they haven&rsquo;t seriously tried them. Not for a weekend side project. Not for a real production task. They tried ChatGPT once, got a wrong answer, and declared the whole thing a parlor trick. That&rsquo;s like using a 1952 compiler once, getting a suboptimal binary, and declaring compilers a dead end.</p>
<p>The people who actually use these tools every day? They&rsquo;re not the ones complaining. They&rsquo;re too busy shipping software.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;always done it this way&rdquo; crowd in 1952 eventually retired. The compiler won. The &ldquo;always done it this way&rdquo; crowd in 2025 will eventually&hellip; well. You see where this is going. This isn&rsquo;t about replacing skill. It&rsquo;s about <em>redirecting</em> skill to higher-value work. The same thing compilers did. The same thing every abstraction layer has done.</p>
<h2 id="what-grace-would-actually-say">What Grace Would Actually Say</h2>
<p>So what <em>would</em> Grace say about all of this?</p>
<p>Look &ndash; she was a Navy officer, a mathematician, a pragmatist, and a radical. She didn&rsquo;t care about the purity of hand-written code. She cared about <em>getting things done.</em> She cared about making computers accessible to more people, solving bigger problems, and not wasting human brainpower on tasks machines could handle.</p>
<p>I think she&rsquo;d say something like: &ldquo;You have a tool that lets you describe what you want in plain English and it writes the code for you? And you&rsquo;re NOT using it? What is <em>wrong</em> with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she&rsquo;d also say this: you still need to understand what you&rsquo;re building. The compiler didn&rsquo;t excuse you from understanding the problem domain. It freed you to <em>focus</em> on it. Same deal here. If you&rsquo;re using an LLM coding agent without understanding architecture, without reviewing the output, without thinking critically about the design &ndash; you&rsquo;re doing it wrong. The tool is a force multiplier. It multiplies whatever you bring to the table. Bring nothing, get nothing.</p>
<p>Grace Hopper would be first in line to use these tools. And she&rsquo;d have zero patience for the naysayers.</p>
<h2 id="the-pattern-never-changes">The Pattern Never Changes</h2>
<p>Every major abstraction in computing history was resisted by the people who had mastered the previous layer. Assembly programmers resisted compilers. C programmers resisted garbage collection. Desktop programmers resisted the web. On-prem folks resisted the cloud.</p>
<p>The pattern is always the same: the new abstraction wins because it lets more people build more things faster. Period. The people who adapt thrive. The people who cling to &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve always done it this way&rdquo; become footnotes.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not a threat. It&rsquo;s an observation. And Grace Hopper made the same observation 70 years ago.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Grace Hopper fought this exact battle in 1952. She had working proof that a higher abstraction layer was not only possible but <em>better</em>, and the establishment refused to accept it. She won. The compiler won. And every programmer alive today benefits from her stubbornness.</p>
<p>The question isn&rsquo;t whether natural-language-directed coding will become normal. It will. The question is whether you&rsquo;ll be one of the people who embraces it, or one of the people who says &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve always done it this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know which side Grace would be on.</p>
<p>Get yourself a counter-clockwise clock.</p>
<p><strong>Be like Grace!</strong></p>
